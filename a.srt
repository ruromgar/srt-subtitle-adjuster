18

Come, Snoop!

It's troubling to the reader,

21
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:16,767
because we know it's your life.

22
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:19,437
Do you think one
can only write from experience?

to an interesting story.

33
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,127
And I decide to put you
in the book I'm writing.

34
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:44,878
And that's it, it's not more.

35

36

And yet I don't know you.

37
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:50,927
What I do know about,
is my interest in you,

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,428
-and that is real.
-Yeah, but still,

39
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,388
you had to meet me first.

40
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:57,016
I'm real, in front of you, now.

41
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:58,643
SANDRA (laughs):
Yes, that you are.

42
00:01:58,726 --> 00:01:59,936
Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,854
So, for you to start inventing,

44
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:03,981
you need something real first.

45
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:06,400
You say your books
always mix truth and fiction,

46
00:02:06,484 --> 00:02:08,778
and that makes us want
to figure out which is which.

47
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:09,779
You want?

48
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:10,863
ZOE: Is that your goal?

49
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:11,906

The parallel, superficial abrasions
on the hands and forearms

179

suggest the body slid
one or two meters upon impact

180

its final, supine position.

or a violent blow to the head.

184

Injury location is inconsistent
with discovery position,

185

thus impact occurred
before the body hit the ground.

186
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:23,147
In conclusion,
we cannot yet determine

187
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:26,192
if the injury resulted
from a collision or a blow.

188
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:31,113
We cannot, at this stage,
rule out third party involvement.

189
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:35,409
Then, the usual.

190
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:37,745
Cause of death: head trauma.

191
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:39,747
Forensic cause:

192
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,124
accidental and/or deliberate.

193
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,921
Toxicological analysis needed
to establish the truth.

SANDRA (in English):
Thank you for coming.

218
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:41,577
VINCENT (quietly):
Yeah, well...

219
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,037
-This is really weird.
-Yes.

220
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,121
-Seeing you again, like this.
-It is.

221
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:47,416
-Okay.
-(Vincent sighs)

222
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,961
I didn't realize it was so high...

223
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:51,879
Yeah.

224
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:54,507
-Come on!
-Yeah.

225
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,138
(in French)
Have you lived here long?

226
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:04,141
(in French)
Less than two years.

227
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:06,894
(in English) It's Samuel,
he grew up here.

228
00:13:06,978 --> 00:13:09,272
-VINCENT: Mm-hmm.
-It's his...

229
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,690
Well...

230
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,654
Well, um...

231
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:21,617
How... How...
How are we gonna do this?

232
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,579
Do you... Will you
ask me some questions and...?

233
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:25,830
-VINCENT: Yeah.
-I'm really sorry

234
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:27,832
that my French isn't any better
than when we met...

235
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:29,792
(in English)
No, uh, English is fine.

236
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,043
SANDRA: Okay.

237
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:32,295
Um...

238
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:36,966
How many times
have you been questioned?

239
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,678
It's been once here
by the policemen

240
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:42,722
and once
by the investigative judge.

241
00:13:44,265 --> 00:13:46,017
VINCENT:
Okay. Can you tell me,

242
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,853
um, what you told them
about the day he died?

243
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:49,937
Yes, of course.

244
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:51,397
SANDRA (in distance):
I told them everything

245
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,274
about the moment
I was with the student

246
00:13:53,357 --> 00:13:55,401
until the ambulance got here.

247
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:58,154
I was in the middle
of a meeting with this girl,

248
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:01,115
and, um, Samuel started...

249
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,909
blasting a song on repeat

250
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:04,493
to piss me off
and make her leave.

251
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,621
Is that what you told them,
that he'd played the song

252
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:08,122
-to piss you off?
-No.

253
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:09,248
No.

254
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:11,209
I just said that

255
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,336
he played the song super loud,
and that we had to stop--

256
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,795
because she was recording
the interview

257
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,297
and it wasn't possible anymore,
it was...

258
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,049
VINCENT:
Hmm. Good.

259
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:21,010
I-- I need you to be precise.

260
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,347
Um, tell me everything, I mean
exactly the way you told them.

261
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,389
Yes.

262
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:26,557
(clears throat)

263
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:27,767
So, I told them

264
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,770
that I put an end to the interview

265
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:32,396
and that she left.

266
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,024
And I went upstairs
to my bedroom.

267
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,319
And that's when I saw Daniel
go out for a walk.

268
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:39,987
He wasn't at school, Daniel?

269
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:41,280
SANDRA: No. He only goes
two days a week,

270
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:42,740
it's in Grenoble.

271
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:45,201
-How old is he now?
-He's 11.

272
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,871
And, um...

273
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,499
So, after the girl left, um...

274
00:14:53,668 --> 00:14:55,753
Samuel came down
to see me in my bedroom

275
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:57,088
and we spoke a little bit

276
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:59,048
about what
we were going to do that day,

277
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,675
it was nothing special, really.

278
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:03,511
And, uh...

279
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:04,971
he...

280
00:15:05,054 --> 00:15:06,973
He went back upstairs
to work in the attic,

281
00:15:07,056 --> 00:15:08,516
and I worked a little in bed.

282
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,852
VINCENT:
You wrote?

283
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:12,436
-On your computer?
-Yes.

284
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,188
I finished a translation.

285
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:15,940
I translate
for several German weeklies,

286
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:17,233
it's for extra money.

287
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,444
And, um...

288
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:22,697
Yeah, I heard him
working upstairs

289
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,366
and play his music for about,

290
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:28,369
I think, it must have been...
10 minutes.

291
00:15:28,452 --> 00:15:31,664
And then I put some earplugs in,
because I wanted to take a nap.

292
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,126
And...

293
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,419
I fell asleep.

294
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:42,717
And an hour later, I think,
I heard Daniel scream.

295
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,094
And, um...

296
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,471
(stammers, clears throat)

297
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,223
One of the earplugs
must have fallen out, I guess,

298
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:51,726
because
it woke me up, and...

299
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,354
the music was still on,
and I ran downstairs, and...

300
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:56,814
Yeah, that's it.

301
00:15:58,024 --> 00:15:59,525
I called the SAMU and they arrived

302
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:00,902
30 minutes later.

303
00:16:01,736 --> 00:16:02,862
Okay.

304
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,784
VINCENT: Um...

305
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,330
Can I take a look around?

306
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:13,456
Of course.

307
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,499
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

308
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,918
VINCENT: Um...

309
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:20,963
Where do you want to start?

310
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:22,757
Should I explain the...

311
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,925
-Something?
-VINCENT: Yeah.

312
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:25,259
Yeah, maybe, I don't know.

313
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,469
Yeah. This is where...

314
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,221
Come on. This is where we eat.

315
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:29,430
(both scoff)

316
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:30,848
-VINCENT: Sorry.
-No.

317
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:58,084
So, ahem, he was
working over there?

318
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,794
Yes, he was insulating the attic.

319
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:03,631
Ah. And, uh,
and when you were having a nap,

320
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:05,007
he was right above you?

321
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,092
Yes.

322
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:07,218
Okay.

323
00:17:15,977 --> 00:17:17,311
SANDRA: So...

324
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:20,231
He was supposed
to get to that next.

325
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:22,316
We wanted
to make rooms for a B&B.

326
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:04,775
So he was working there?

327
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,319
SANDRA:
These days, yes.

328
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:11,282
VINCENT:
The... window?

329
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:14,118
Do you remember when
the ambulance arrived, was it open?

330
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:15,369
Yes, it was.

331
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,290
VINCENT:
He used to keep it open?

332
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:21,501
Um, I'm not sure of that really,

333
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:23,878
because, uh, sometimes
he would air the room,

334
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,213
you know, because
he wanted to get rid

335
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:26,672
of the wood dust and...

336
00:18:26,756 --> 00:18:28,090
VINCENT: Was he reckless?
I mean, did he ever

337
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,134
take some risks when he was working?

338
00:18:30,218 --> 00:18:32,803
No. He was very cautious
and meticulous--

339
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:34,222
he worked slowly.

340
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,525
VINCENT: Is there any reason
why he would have

341
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,109
leaned out the window,

342
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,320
for instance to call out
to you or Daniel?

343
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:50,988
No. When he was working,

344
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:53,533
especially when
he was playing his music,

345
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:56,077
he, he kind of...

346
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,621
he shut himself off
from the rest of the world.

347
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,082
So he never called for me
or Daniel up here.

348
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:03,000
VINCENT:
Mmm. Well, anyway,

349
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:05,169
with the height of the...

350
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:06,796
(speaks French)

351
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,922
SANDRA:
Windowsill.

352
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:09,966
-Windowsill...
-SANDRA: Yeah.

353
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:13,970
Had he been drinking?

354
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,638
SANDRA: No, he never drank
during the day,

355
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,390
especially when he was working.

356
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:24,313
(Daniel sobbing)

357
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:27,775
SANDRA (in French):
Sweetie.

358
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:29,944
(in English)
You need to wash up

359
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:31,028
and get dressed. It's daytime,

360
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:32,488
you need to get up.

361
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:35,825
Honey, I know this is hard,

362
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,785
it's hard for me too,

363
00:19:37,869 --> 00:19:39,328
and it's going to be hard for a while.

364
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,122
-(sobbing continues)
-(footsteps approaching up stairs)

365
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:42,665
But we have to try

366
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,542
and do the things
that we did before.

367
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:45,960
-Because I...
-(footsteps stop)

368
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,341
Look, Monica came to see you,
she made you tiramisu.

369
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,551
Yeah...

370
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,222
You can't spend whole days
like this without going outside.

371
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:01,017
It's beautiful out,
and Snoop needs to go out too.

372
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,861
MONICA (in French):
Daniel, will you come eat with us?

373
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,654
DANIEL (in tears):
I want to sleep.

374
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:17,325
MONICA: Okay, first eat
with us, then you can sleep.

375
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:20,411
(Vincent chatting outside)

376
00:20:34,926 --> 00:20:36,928
(Daniel sobbing quietly)

377
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,819
DANIEL:
I don't understand.

378
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:57,323
MONICA:
No one understands.

379
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:59,033
We can't understand.

380
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:05,414
DANIEL:
I have to understand.

381
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:15,049
Remember the psychic
I told you about,

382
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:17,593
the one I saw when Alain died?

383
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:19,846
Monica.

384
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:21,138
DANIEL:
I'd like to.

385
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:23,140
I'd rather you don't...

386
00:21:23,224 --> 00:21:25,393
He helped me a lot.

387
00:21:25,476 --> 00:21:26,894
But he's a child.

388
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:28,396
Don't confuse things.

389
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,981
I'll discuss it with Monica.

390
00:21:30,064 --> 00:21:31,941
MONICA:
He's helped children before.

391
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,445
SANDRA:
Want some?

392
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:40,116
(Monica departs)

393
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,576
(sobbing continues)

394
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,457
(in English)
What do you need?

395
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,042
DANIEL (in French):
Nothing, I'm okay.

396
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:51,210
Okay.

397
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:54,005
SANDRA: Mm.

398
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,639
MONICA (in French):
Your doubts aside, it might help him.

399
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:06,601
He senses things we can't.

400
00:22:08,352 --> 00:22:10,021
(in French)
Vincent, an old lawyer friend,

401
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:12,190
Monica, Daniel's godmother.

402
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,941
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

403
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:16,444
-SANDRA: I'll call you.
-MONICA: Tell me if he eats.

404
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:20,364
(door closes)

405
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:21,490
VINCENT:
Uh...

406
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,700
(in English)
Uh, the plates?

407
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:23,910
-There.
-Yeah.

408
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:25,536
(opens drawer)

409
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,954
(plates clatter)

410
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,711
(sobbing)

411
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:36,797
I'm so tired of crying.

412
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:38,883
It's really ridiculous.
I'm so exhausted.

413
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,595
-You want parmesan?
-Yes. Yeah, it's perfect.

414
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:43,888
And I don't know
where the pepper--

415
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:44,972
VINCENT:
Don't worry,

416
00:22:45,056 --> 00:22:46,432
I'll take care of everything.

417
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,311
So, as you know,
the autopsy report

418
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:52,563
is inconclusive
about the cause of death.

419
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:55,107
-Mm-hmm.
-The forensic pathologist

420
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:57,485
didn't have enough
concrete elements.

421
00:22:57,568 --> 00:23:00,196
-But...
-(scribbling with marker)

422
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,281
what we can defend is

423
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:04,992
a fall from the attic window,

424
00:23:05,076 --> 00:23:09,497
with him "bouncing" off the shed's roof.

425
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,457
His head may have hit the edge

426
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:13,334
somewhere around here.

427
00:23:15,044 --> 00:23:16,003
You see?

428
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:17,171
SANDRA: Okay.

429
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:18,548
VINCENT:
Then he would have landed

430
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:21,300
on the ground, approximately here.

431
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,344
And it seems that he found the strength

432
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:25,304
to crawl one meter or two

433
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:28,933
before collapsing in this final position.

434
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:32,019
That explains the blood on the snow.

435
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:34,063
But there are several problems.

436
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,648
First, they found nothing on the roof--

437
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:37,692
no DNA, nothing.

438
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:38,943
And there is this...

439
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:41,195
three blood spatters here on the wall.

440
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,073
It seems it doesn't really match

441
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,826
with the... head impact on the roof.

442
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:49,412
And the judge has asked
an expert to clarify this.

443
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,830
SANDRA: Mm-hmm.

444
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:53,332
And, when you see this,
what do you think?

445
00:23:55,084 --> 00:23:57,086
Um, I don't know,

446
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,173
I'm not a spatter analyst,

447
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,926
but, uh, I know a very good one.

448
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,553
So, I'm gonna get her opinion.

449
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,235
There's one last problem
for us, the...

450
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,862
that bruise on your arm.

451
00:24:24,488 --> 00:24:28,284
It might look like the result
of a fight, struggle.

452
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,744
SANDRA:
Oh, yeah. Ahem.

453
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:31,495
Well, when did they see it?

454
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:33,247
They examined me
that same night.

455
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:34,999
My sleeve was rolled up
and they saw it.

456
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:37,168
Okay, and you explained it
to them right away?

457
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:38,586
Yeah, I knew exactly
how it happened.

458
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:40,755
-Should I show you?
-Yeah, please.

459
00:24:40,838 --> 00:24:42,715
Ahem. So, when I'm here
in the kitchen,

460
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:44,967
I bang my arm
on this all the time, you see?

461
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,594
Like when I move. Heh.

462
00:24:46,677 --> 00:24:47,845
It's ridiculous.

463
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:49,972
It happened several times that week,

464
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:52,683
and, uh, I told them
that my skin marks easily,

465
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,685
and they could ask Daniel
because he hears me

466
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:56,312
bumping into it all the time.

467
00:24:56,395 --> 00:24:57,688
Okay, well...

468
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:03,486
So, as you can see,

469
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,571
an accidental fall
is gonna be hard to defend,

470
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:08,407
given the height
of the... windowsill.

471
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:09,909
-SANDRA: Mm-hmm.
-So that's why

472
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:11,244
there's an investigation

473
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:14,121
for "mort suspecte,"

474
00:25:14,205 --> 00:25:15,748
uh, and you're, you're,

475
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:18,084
you're "mort susp--,"
suspicious death. Yeah.

476
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,669
And you're a témoin assisté
because you were

477
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:21,254
the only person there.

478
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:22,839
Okay.

479
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:24,674
And, of course, you're his wife.

480
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:27,927
Um, now, looking for a stranger

481
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,345
who walks in, kills him

482
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,430
while you were sleeping right above

483
00:25:31,514 --> 00:25:34,517
and Daniel was out for a walk
is a shitty strategy:

484
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,018
Samuel had no enemies

485
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,145
-that make...
-Stop, stop.

486
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:39,814
I did not kill him.

487
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:45,653
That's not the point.

488
00:25:45,736 --> 00:25:46,946
Really.

489
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:48,030
Um...

490
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:53,286
We have to go through
Samuel's personality.

491
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:55,621
What was he going through lately...

492
00:25:57,665 --> 00:26:01,919
Is there anything that would
seem consistent with a suicide?

493
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,052
I thought about this, obviously,

494
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:11,846
but I just can't imagine him jumping

495
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:13,222
with Daniel so close by.

496
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:16,100
It's just...
I just can't get it in my head.

497
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,398
Yeah, but it's probably
our best defense.

498
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,859
I mean, if they indict you,

499
00:26:24,942 --> 00:26:26,736
it's our only defense.

500
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:29,113
But I think he fell.

501
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,533
Yeah, but nobody
is going to believe that.

502
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,870
I don't believe that.

503
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:40,166
I need a smoke.

504
00:26:44,337 --> 00:26:46,255
(website playing Albeniz'
"Asturias (Leyenda)")

505
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:59,435
(Daniel playing
"Asturias (Leyenda)" on piano)

506
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:11,364
SANDRA: Vincent...

507
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:13,908
there is something I, uh,
I want to tell you about.

508
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:15,826
(Daniel continues playing)

509
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,162
About six months ago,

510
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:22,500
I wonder if Samuel
didn't swallow some pills.

511
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:26,629
I found him passed out drunk
on the floor, he vomited.

512
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:29,674
It was very early
in the morning. I...

513
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:33,052
There were
some white spots in the vomit,

514
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:36,639
and I remember wondering
if they were pills.

515
00:27:36,722 --> 00:27:38,933
VINCENT (over phone):
<i>Eh... really?</i>

516
00:27:39,016 --> 00:27:40,017
Yes.

517
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:41,853
<i>And did you talk to him</i>

518
00:27:41,936 --> 00:27:43,896
<i>-after... afterwards?
</i>-No, he didn't want to talk about it.

519
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:46,274
<i>Did Daniel see this?</i>

520
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:47,650
No.

521
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,069
<i>And you... called for a doctor or...</i>

522
00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:51,904
No. No, I didn't realize it

523
00:27:51,988 --> 00:27:54,073
back then,
but looking back at it now,

524
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:57,702
it seems like it might have been
a suicide attempt, no?

525
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,042
<i>Does anyone know about this?</i>

526
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:06,586
No.

527
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:10,965
<i>Okay. Uh, I call you back.</i>

528
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:12,091
Yes.

529
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:13,676
<i>-Okay, bye.
</i>-Bye.

530
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:17,680
(continues playing

531
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:29,650

532
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:40,745
(chuckles)

534
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:17,323
JUDGE JANVIER (in French):
Is the light too bright?

535
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:20,493
Want me to lower the blinds?

536
00:29:21,369 --> 00:29:22,787
I'm okay.

537
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,955
JUDGE JANVIER:
Yeah?

538
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:25,206
Okay.

539
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:28,751
You didn't tell me
about your parents' arguments.

540
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:34,715
What do you mean?
I don't really remember any.

541
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:38,970
When they start yelling,

542
00:29:39,053 --> 00:29:40,555
I prefer to leave.

543
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:44,141
JUDGE JANVIER:
Can you tell me who was angrier?

544
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,644
No.

545
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,232
JUDGE JANVIER:
Is that why you left

546
00:29:51,315 --> 00:29:53,401
the day your dad died?

547
00:29:53,484 --> 00:29:56,028
No, I just felt like a walk.

548
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:57,572
JUDGE JANVIER: Okay.

549
00:29:57,655 --> 00:30:00,616
You say you heard your parents
when you left?

550
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,411
Do you remember the conversation?

551
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:06,539
More or less. It wasn't a fight.

552
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:11,878
I couldn't hear the words,
but it wasn't...

553
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:14,714
JUDGE JANVIER:
Then you don't know if it was a fight.

554
00:30:14,797 --> 00:30:18,384
I could tell...
I could hear it wasn't a fight.

555
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:21,804
JUDGE JANVIER: Daniel, the music
was loud, you were outside.

556
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:24,515
They were in her bedroom,
two floors up.

557
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:26,767
How can you be sure?

558
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:30,229
I wonder if you could hear them at all.

559
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:32,982
I was just below the open window.

560
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,734
I know what I heard.

561
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:38,154
JUDGE JANVIER: Okay.

562
00:30:43,826 --> 00:30:44,869
DANIEL:
Is it over?

563
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:49,624
How can you be so sure
where you were?

564
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:52,126
DANIEL:
Because I touched the...

565
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,086
gaffer tape on the woodshed.

566
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:56,797
Gaffer tape?

567
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:58,591
DANIEL:
When we moved in,

568
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:02,094
Dad put tape
with different textures everywhere,

569
00:31:02,178 --> 00:31:03,846
-so I could feel my way.
-Right...

570
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:08,392
I don't really need them now,
but I still touch them.

571
00:31:08,476 --> 00:31:10,436
Each piece feels different,

572
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,938
I wouldn't get it wrong.

573
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,024
I touched the woodshed tape.

574
00:31:16,817 --> 00:31:18,611
So I was under the window.

575
00:31:18,694 --> 00:31:19,820
Okay.

576
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,910
(people chattering)

577
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:28,120
JUDGE JANVIER (in French):
I transposed what you told me.

578
00:31:28,204 --> 00:31:30,289
But I didn't say it in French.

579
00:31:30,373 --> 00:31:32,542
JUDGE JANVIER:
The volume is what matters here,

580
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:35,253
and French is easier for everyone.

581
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:38,297
SANDRA GENDARME:
Hélène, start the music.

582
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:41,217
("P.I.M.P." by Bacao Rhythm
& Steel Band playing over speakers)

583
00:31:44,428 --> 00:31:45,555
SAMUEL GENDARME:
Did it go well?

584
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,723
Yes, nothing special.

585
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:49,517
SAMUEL GENDARME:
What's next this afternoon?

586
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,771
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.

587
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:55,064
SAMUEL GENDARME:
Not asking me?

588
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,942
SANDRA: I assume you'll
keep working in the attic?

589
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:00,403
JUDGE JANVIER:
Stop the music.

590
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,071
-ASSISTANT: Stop.
-(music stops)

591
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,114
So?

592
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:04,448
Did you hear anything?

593
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,286
JUDGE JANVIER:
Let's go again, louder this time.

594
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:12,373
Louder? But I didn't shout at all.

595
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:14,000
JUDGE JANVIER:
The point of the reenactment is

596
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:15,751
to determine a credible volume.

597
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:18,921
Vincent, I never shouted.

598
00:32:19,672 --> 00:32:23,426
VINCENT: She spoke no louder.
Her son says the voices were calm.

599
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,719
JUDGE JANVIER:
That doesn't hold up.

600
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:26,345
The music drowns them out.

601
00:32:27,263 --> 00:32:28,639
VINCENT:
My client didn't shout.

602
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,391
She won't shout now.

603
00:32:31,893 --> 00:32:34,979
JUDGE JANVIER:
Miss, please replace Ms. Voyter.

604
00:32:35,062 --> 00:32:37,565
-JUDGE: Come on in.
-ASSISTANT: Come on in, please.

605
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,318
Play the music.

606
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:42,069
SANDRA GENDARME:
Start the music!

607
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:43,863
("P.I.M.P" playing over speakers)

608
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:46,240
SAMUEL GENDARME (loudly):
Did it go well?

609
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:47,658
(loudly)
Yes, nothing special.

610
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:49,869
What's next this afternoon?

611
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:52,872
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.

612
00:32:57,752 --> 00:32:58,836
(speaks French)

613
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:01,839
JUDGE JANVIER:
Go again, much louder.

614
00:33:02,882 --> 00:33:04,008
SAMUEL GENDARME (louder):
Was it good?

615
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:05,551
SANDRA GENDARME (louder):
Yes, nothing special.

616
00:33:06,511 --> 00:33:07,762
What's next this afternoon?

617
00:33:07,845 --> 00:33:11,265
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.

618
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,476
Not asking me?

619
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,937
SANDRA GENDARME: I assume
you'll keep working in the attic?

620
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:18,022
SANDRA GENDARME:
Stop the music.

621
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,025
-JUDGE JANVIER: Now they hear it.
-(music stops)

622
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:21,943
Good.

623
00:33:22,902 --> 00:33:25,029
You do realize that was ridiculous?

624
00:33:25,112 --> 00:33:27,156
JUDGE JANVIER:
Spare me your comments.

625
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,451
DANIEL:
It was calm voices, not like that.

626
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:33,913
But see, you wouldn't have heard them.

627
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:37,250
Right?

628
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,797
DANIEL: Can we try
one last time, starting inside?

629
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,924
With calm voices again.

630
00:33:46,842 --> 00:33:47,760
We can.

631
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:49,136
("P.I.M.P" playing over speakers)

632
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,351
(people speaking faintly in distance)

633
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:14,411
I made a mistake.

634
00:34:14,495 --> 00:34:15,830
-JUDGE JANVIER: Cut the music.
-(music stops)

635
00:34:15,913 --> 00:34:18,666
This is the tape I touched. I was inside.

636
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,918
I got mixed up.

637
00:34:22,003 --> 00:34:23,713
JUDGE JANVIER:
That's not what you told us.

638
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:27,382
Zoé Solidor saw you
leave the house after she left.

639
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:30,261
And your mom says
she spoke to your dad after  that.

640
00:34:31,262 --> 00:34:32,722
I got mixed up.

641
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,099
You got mixed up.

642
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:40,146
(piano playing "Asturias
(Leyenda)" in distance)

643
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,862
(playing with inconsistent tempo)

644
00:35:18,142 --> 00:35:21,437
(playing Chopin's "Opus 28 No. 4")

645
00:36:01,978 --> 00:36:03,145
(both stop playing)

646
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,294
(in English) This afternoon
was hard, wasn't it?

647
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:33,968
DANIEL (in French):
I'm mad at myself.

648
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:37,930
I thought I was sure, and then...

649
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:39,974
(in English)
But you didn't lie, did you?

650
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:42,310
No.

651
00:36:44,896 --> 00:36:47,398
I don't want you to change
your memories, you know.

652
00:36:48,316 --> 00:36:51,194
You have to tell them exactly
like you remember it.

653
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,863
That can never hurt me.

654
00:36:58,451 --> 00:36:59,744
Give me your hand.

655
00:37:02,496 --> 00:37:03,664
Oui?

656
00:37:05,541 --> 00:37:07,168
(chuckles)

657
00:37:07,251 --> 00:37:09,378
(Sandra laughs)

658
00:37:09,462 --> 00:37:11,297
What do we do now?

659
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,341
Huh? Huh?

660
00:37:13,424 --> 00:37:15,051
You want a drink?

661
00:37:15,134 --> 00:37:16,219
Whisky?

662
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:17,970
(both laugh)

663
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:20,014
Come on.

664
00:37:20,097 --> 00:37:21,474
SANDRA: Ahh...

665
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:22,642
-SANDRA: Oh.
-DANIEL: Oh, sorry.

666
00:37:22,725 --> 00:37:23,726
SANDRA:
It's all right.

667
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,186
(kisses)

668
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:28,856
(in French)
All I can say is,

669
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,486
the interrogation is in progress
and may continue for a while.

670
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:36,239
REPORTER:
She's been in there for eight hours.

671
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:37,657
Is she in trouble?

672
00:37:38,366 --> 00:37:40,535
Sandra Voyter is not in trouble.

673
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:42,453
She maintains her innocence,

674
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:44,539
so there will be no confession.

675
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:48,167
REPORTER: You're confident,
but we've heard about a recording.

676
00:37:48,251 --> 00:37:49,752
Is it incriminating?

677
00:37:50,294 --> 00:37:52,213
You're not listening.

678
00:37:52,296 --> 00:37:56,050
She has not been indicted,
so nothing is incriminating.

679
00:37:56,801 --> 00:37:58,928
The so-called video is a myth so far.

680
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:01,055
We've had no access to it.

681
00:38:01,138 --> 00:38:03,516
REPORTER:
So, you confirm it's a video?

682
00:38:04,225 --> 00:38:08,229
No, I confirm nothing.
I said precisely the opposite.

683
00:38:08,312 --> 00:38:10,857
REPORTER: If there's nothing new,
why the summons?

684
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,234
I don't know what to tell you.

685
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:15,903
We don't understand it
ourselves. Thank you.

686
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:19,574
PROSECUTOR (in French):
Thank you for coming

687
00:38:20,575 --> 00:38:22,827
for the public prosecutor's statement.

688
00:38:24,537 --> 00:38:27,999
So, Sandra Voyter was indicted
this morning at 8:30 a.m.

689
00:38:28,499 --> 00:38:32,336
The investigation revealed elements
that justify this decision.

690
00:38:33,171 --> 00:38:35,131
Three elements in particular.

691
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:38,593
Analyses of Mr. Maleski's blood spatter

692
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:41,345
found at the couple's domicile

693
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:46,184
indicate he may have received
a blunt force blow to the head

694
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:49,312
when he was on the third-floor balcony.

695
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:51,355
In addition,

696
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:53,900
the reenactment done three days ago

697
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,736
brought to light
a number of discrepancies.

698
00:38:57,486 --> 00:38:58,696
Lastly,

699
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:04,118
a file was discovered on a USB key
belonging to Mr. Maleski.

700
00:39:04,202 --> 00:39:06,829
All I can say about it, for now,

701
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:10,249
is that it's an audio recording
of the couple,

702
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,959
made the day before his death.

703
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:15,296
(people chattering)

704
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:19,300
(in French) As I'm trying to tell you,
she can't come sign herself

705
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:23,179
because she's held up
at the courthouse.

706
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:26,140
So it'll be me,
her lawyer Vincent Renzi,

707
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:29,101
coming to get the documents for her.

708
00:39:29,894 --> 00:39:31,562
No, I can't come at 11.

709
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:34,899
I can be there in 20 minutes?

710
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,319
Okay. Thanks, be right there.

711
00:39:38,402 --> 00:39:39,820
NOUR:
We have good news.

712
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:44,242
The judge this afternoon
is not Da Silva, it's Bollène.

713
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,576
VINCENT: Okay.

714
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,953
I'm off to the bank.

715
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:48,663
NOUR:
And the home equity loan?

716
00:39:48,746 --> 00:39:51,082
Ah, si, si, si.

717
00:39:51,165 --> 00:39:54,836
Less than we hoped.
They have money problems.

718
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,587
Outstanding credit, etcetera.

719
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:59,674
The bank will only do 50,000.

720
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:02,718
NOUR:
Bail will be more than that.

721
00:40:03,886 --> 00:40:06,180
(in French)
Her son is a witness.

722
00:40:06,264 --> 00:40:08,349
He'll be testifying in court.

723
00:40:08,432 --> 00:40:12,770
There is obviously a risk
of her exerting pressure on him.

724
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:14,772
As a consequence,

725
00:40:14,856 --> 00:40:17,525
release on bail is not an option.

726
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:21,779
I'm asking you to place Ms. Voyter
in detention pending trial.

727
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:25,283
Thank you.
Over to you, Ms. Boudaoud.

728
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:28,661
Judge, how can we consider her
a flight risk,

729
00:40:28,744 --> 00:40:31,080
when she's responsible for her son?

730
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:32,707
<i>That makes no sense.</i>

731
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,917
<i>With a visually impaired child?</i>

732
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:37,587
<i>And she's all over the media.</i>

733
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,798
<i>Separating them
could compound his trauma.</i>

734
00:40:40,882 --> 00:40:44,260
<i>He had an accident at the age of four</i>

735
00:40:44,343 --> 00:40:45,428
<i>that damaged his sight.</i>

736
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,180
<i>He's been traumatized,</i>

737
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:49,891
<i>both psychologically
and emotionally.</i>

738
00:40:49,974 --> 00:40:50,975
SANDRA: Oh.

739
00:40:52,852 --> 00:40:54,562
REPORTER 1:
Ms. Boudaoud, your reaction?

740
00:40:55,313 --> 00:40:59,066
The judge's decision
is rare enough to merit praise.

741
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,737
A judge refusing to give in
to repressive reflexes

742
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,448
is a healthy sign,
especially in such a case.

743
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:08,993
We feel the release
under judicial supervision

744
00:41:09,076 --> 00:41:11,245
underscores the weakness
of the case.

745
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:13,039
REPORTER 2:
Is your client relieved?

746
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,212
This is a rare decision
in a homicide accusation,

747
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:21,881
and reads like
a repudiation of Judge Janvier.

748
00:41:21,964 --> 00:41:25,051
Reactions in the hallways
have been intense.

749
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:28,221
<i>I quote,
"This decision is dangerous.</i>

750
00:41:28,513 --> 00:41:31,265
<i>"The suspect will be reunited
with a major witness.</i>

751
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:34,936
<i>It's a real concern
for the upcoming trial."</i>

752
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:48,950
VINCENT (in English): How could
you not tell me about it?

753
00:41:49,033 --> 00:41:50,618
SANDRA (in English):
I had no idea he recorded it.

754
00:41:50,701 --> 00:41:52,078
VINCENT:
Even if he hadn't, I mean,

755
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:54,080
you had a fight
the day before he died.

756
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,006
(car door closes)

757
00:42:12,348 --> 00:42:16,394
SANDRA:
That recording is not reality.

758
00:42:17,562 --> 00:42:18,980
It is a part of it, maybe.

759
00:42:19,063 --> 00:42:21,482
If you have
an extreme moment in life,

760
00:42:21,566 --> 00:42:23,192
an emotional peak,
and you focus on it,

761
00:42:23,276 --> 00:42:25,653
of course, it crushes everything.

762
00:42:25,736 --> 00:42:27,738
It may seem like irrefutable proof,

763
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:29,615
but actually warps everything.

764
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:31,033
It's not reality.

765
00:42:31,117 --> 00:42:33,119
It's our voices, that's true,
but it's not who we are.

766
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:36,247
I don't give a fuck
about what is reality, okay?

767
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,541
You-- you need to start
seeing yourself

768
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:40,835
the way others are going
to perceive you.

769
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:42,712
A trial is not about
"The Truth," it's about...

770
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:44,172
I didn't know
there would be a trial.

771
00:42:44,255 --> 00:42:45,882
VINCENT: Well, there is.

772
00:42:56,517 --> 00:43:00,605
VINCENT: Now, what
will really count is, uh,

773
00:43:00,688 --> 00:43:02,732
who you have around you.

774
00:43:02,815 --> 00:43:04,066
There's nobody around me.

775
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,444
-Yes, there is Daniel.
-Yeah.

776
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:07,987
Daniel is important.

777
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:12,283
And didn't you and Samuel
have any...

778
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:13,826
any friends, someone...

779
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,369
I should never have come here.

780
00:43:15,453 --> 00:43:17,997
I didn't want to,
I was so happy in London.

781
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,877
It was him.
He insisted so much.

782
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,047
He said there'd be
no more distractions from work,

783
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,633
it would solve our financial problems...

784
00:43:28,716 --> 00:43:30,801
(dry chuckle)

785
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,266
I left my shithole in Germany

786
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,393
and ended up stuck here...
in his shithole.

787
00:43:39,477 --> 00:43:41,354
It's fucking absurd,
isn't it, come on?

788
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,611
(people chattering in French)

789
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:50,613
(Sandra and Nour, in French)
Hello.

790
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,283
(in French)
Hi, kitten.

791
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,828
NOUR (in French):
This is Ms. Berger,

792
00:43:57,912 --> 00:44:00,331
appointed by the Justice Minister.

793
00:44:00,414 --> 00:44:01,832
VINCENT: Bonjour.

794
00:44:01,916 --> 00:44:03,876
Vincent Renzi, I work with Nour.

795
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,046
-NOUR: She'll be here regularly, with...
-MARGE: Bonjour.

796
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,632
Daniel, and with you.

797
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,176
The frequency will be specified.

798
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,262
She's here...

799
00:44:15,263 --> 00:44:17,765
to ensure that everything goes well.

800
00:44:18,349 --> 00:44:22,144
And that no one
tries to influence Daniel,

801
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:26,148
or make him say things
he doesn't want to say at the trial.

802
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:31,028
The judge says
you must speak French in her presence.

803
00:44:33,155 --> 00:44:34,115
Right.

804
00:44:37,785 --> 00:44:38,828
NOUR: That's it.

805
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:43,124
May I speak with Daniel in private?

806
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:44,750
MARGE: Mm-hmm?

807
00:44:45,668 --> 00:44:47,920
VINCENT (in English):
Uh, okay, so we go?

808
00:44:48,004 --> 00:44:49,005
VINCENT (in French):
I'll call you.

809
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:52,216
MARGE (in French): Your mother
will give us space to get acquainted.

810
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:00,600
MARGE:
My name is Marge.

811
00:45:01,225 --> 00:45:03,102
We'll see each other a lot.

812
00:45:04,061 --> 00:45:06,230
Do you know why I'm here?

813
00:45:06,314 --> 00:45:08,065
-DANIEL: Mm. Mm-hmm.
-Are you okay with it?

814
00:45:09,525 --> 00:45:11,402
You can consider me a friend.

815
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:14,655
Or not. That's your choice.

816
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:16,073
What do you think?

817
00:45:16,824 --> 00:45:18,284
It's okay, I don't...

818
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:20,995
I don't need us to be friends.

819
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,460
MARGE: Well, I'm here
to protect your testimony.

820
00:45:28,211 --> 00:45:30,046
The law sent me, and...

821
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,257
the law can't be someone's friend.

822
00:45:33,341 --> 00:45:36,636
Otherwise it couldn't be
someone else's friend,

823
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:39,180
and the law must be
the same for everyone.

824
00:45:40,473 --> 00:45:42,767
So you're right,
I can't be your friend.

825
00:45:44,227 --> 00:45:47,813
You just have to tell me
if anything feels strange,

826
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:50,775
if there's a problem,

827
00:45:50,858 --> 00:45:51,984
I don't know,

828
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:53,945
for example with your mom,

829
00:45:54,028 --> 00:45:55,488
regarding the trial.

830
00:45:57,323 --> 00:46:01,285
I usually discuss stuff like that
with my friends.

831
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:04,830
Right.

832
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:08,209
Maybe this time
you don't really have a choice.

833
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,014
(deeply exhales)

834
00:46:28,312 --> 00:46:30,022
-DANIEL: S'il vous plaît.
-SANDRA: S'il vous plaît.

835
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:32,400
DANIEL (in French):
...with chocolate chips...

836
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:34,485
(Sandra repeats Daniel)

837
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:36,070
DANIEL:
and raspberries...

838
00:46:36,153 --> 00:46:37,238
(Sandra repeats Daniel)

839
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:40,116
DANIEL: I know it doesn't exist,
but I want it.

840
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:45,079
(Sandra laughs and repeats Daniel)

841
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,583
The archduchess' socks...

842
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,168
(Sandra partially repeats Daniel)

843
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:51,169
SANDRA: What?

844
00:46:51,252 --> 00:46:52,211
(both laugh)

845
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:55,381
DANIEL:
The archduchess' socks...

846
00:46:55,464 --> 00:46:57,967
(Sandra repeats Daniel)

847
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,886
(church bell ringing in distance)

848
00:47:27,163 --> 00:47:28,706
SANDRA (in English):
<i>He was-- He was one of</i>

849
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:30,333
the only persons I knew,

850
00:47:30,416 --> 00:47:32,919
when he walked into a room,

851
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:35,171
something shifted.

852
00:47:35,254 --> 00:47:37,590
The-- The atmosphere changed.

853
00:47:37,673 --> 00:47:39,842
And I suppose
that's charm, isn't it?

854
00:47:39,926 --> 00:47:43,137
It's, um...
I-I fell in love with his charm.

855
00:47:44,263 --> 00:47:45,431
Um...

856
00:47:47,308 --> 00:47:49,977
I'd spent my whole life
not understanding

857
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:52,980
my family and friends,

858
00:47:53,064 --> 00:47:54,482
and then he came along,

859
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:56,400
and I felt like...

860
00:47:57,818 --> 00:47:59,695
I understood what he was saying,

861
00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:02,281
the signals
that he was sending me.

862
00:48:02,365 --> 00:48:03,824
The, um...

863
00:48:03,908 --> 00:48:05,785
We didn't necessarily agree,

864
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:07,119
but we had...

865
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:10,706
Uh, we had things
to tell each other.

866
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:11,874
(lighter pings)

867
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,209
And I realized it later

868
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:14,752
when it was gone, so...

869
00:48:14,836 --> 00:48:16,420
Mm. Don't say it's gone.

870
00:48:18,172 --> 00:48:21,843
Just, um, focus on him,
how you met.

871
00:48:24,136 --> 00:48:26,097
When we met,
he'd just gotten a job

872
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,474
at a university in London,

873
00:48:28,558 --> 00:48:30,977
so, ahem, we moved there together.

874
00:48:33,229 --> 00:48:34,480
He was a great teacher.

875
00:48:34,564 --> 00:48:35,648
(laughs) He was...

876
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:36,983
He had a... He had a way

877
00:48:37,066 --> 00:48:40,862
of making everything sound alive
and accessible, it was great.

878
00:48:42,697 --> 00:48:45,908
But, um, that wasn't really enough,

879
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:49,537
heh, so deep down,

880
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,164
what he really wanted to do
was to write.

881
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:55,293
And he was working on
a novel for years.

882
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:56,586
I-I watched him struggle.

883
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:58,254
It was hard.

884
00:48:58,337 --> 00:48:59,547
Um...

885
00:49:03,134 --> 00:49:04,844
And I came to realize

886
00:49:04,927 --> 00:49:08,055
that his relationship
with time, with, with work,

887
00:49:08,139 --> 00:49:12,351
was complicated,
unlike for me, for example.

888
00:49:12,435 --> 00:49:14,937
VINCENT: No, stop com--
Stop comparing yourself to him.

889
00:49:15,021 --> 00:49:16,105
Just, uh...

890
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:17,815
go back to your relationship.

891
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:25,072
SANDRA: Our relationship
revolved around...

892
00:49:25,156 --> 00:49:26,574
intellectual stimulation,

893
00:49:26,657 --> 00:49:29,619
even if it meant neglecting
everything else.

894
00:49:29,702 --> 00:49:30,786
Everything else?

895
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:32,997
(in French)
Meaning Daniel?

896
00:49:34,874 --> 00:49:36,834
We should mention Daniel early on.

897
00:49:36,918 --> 00:49:38,669
VINCENT (in English):
The accident.

898
00:49:38,753 --> 00:49:41,214
SANDRA:
Okay. I didn't know it was sent.

899
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,716
(laughs)

900
00:49:44,675 --> 00:49:45,760
VINCENT: It's okay?

901
00:49:45,843 --> 00:49:47,428
It's okay.

902
00:49:47,512 --> 00:49:49,305
It's just that, I didn't know

903
00:49:49,388 --> 00:49:52,558
that it was so, uh,
like this. Okay.

904
00:49:52,642 --> 00:49:53,684
Um...

905
00:49:53,768 --> 00:49:54,936
(door opens)

906
00:49:56,521 --> 00:49:57,897
Everything changed

907
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,982
after the accident.

908
00:50:00,066 --> 00:50:02,068
Uh, Daniel was four.

909
00:50:03,736 --> 00:50:05,112
(sighs) That day,

910
00:50:05,196 --> 00:50:09,450
Samuel was supposed
to pick him up from school.

911
00:50:09,534 --> 00:50:11,536
But he was on a roll
with his writing,

912
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:14,789
so he called a babysitter
at the last minute

913
00:50:14,872 --> 00:50:16,874
and the babysitter showed up late.

914
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,544
And as they were crossing
the street,

915
00:50:19,627 --> 00:50:21,087
a motorcycle hit Daniel,

916
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,714
his optic nerve
was permanently damaged.

917
00:50:29,136 --> 00:50:31,138
After that,

918
00:50:31,222 --> 00:50:34,559
Samuel became obsessive about it,

919
00:50:34,642 --> 00:50:36,227
he blamed himself on a loop:

920
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:38,062
If only he'd
come pick him up on time...

921
00:50:38,145 --> 00:50:39,272
(vocalizes)

922
00:50:41,065 --> 00:50:43,526
He was overcome with guilt...

923
00:50:46,487 --> 00:50:48,656
and perhaps he never
truly escaped that feeling.

924
00:50:50,366 --> 00:50:54,954
We spent that whole year
at the hospital with Daniel.

925
00:50:56,289 --> 00:50:59,125
We began having
financial problems...

926
00:51:00,376 --> 00:51:03,254
and Samuel started taking
antidepressants.

927
00:51:04,714 --> 00:51:06,215
Sorry, can we please

928
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:08,050
keep that clean, Vincent?

929
00:51:08,134 --> 00:51:09,886
I would really like to protect him,

930
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:12,054
and his image, and spare Daniel.

931
00:51:14,098 --> 00:51:15,308
VINCENT:
We'll try.

932
00:51:15,391 --> 00:51:17,143
Okay.

933
00:51:17,226 --> 00:51:19,061
But it would be like that--
I have to--

934
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:20,730
-I have to--
-VINCENT: Yes.

935
00:51:20,813 --> 00:51:23,232
I have to admit things.

936
00:51:25,234 --> 00:51:27,153
VINCENT (stammers):
You have to prepare yourself

937
00:51:27,236 --> 00:51:29,572
-to tell everything...
-(blows raspberry)

938
00:51:29,655 --> 00:51:31,616
and the challenge is
to do it in French.

939
00:51:33,868 --> 00:51:34,911
Okay.

940

00:52:30,216 --> 00:52:31,217

955

SANDRA (laughs): <i>What do
you know about drugs then?</i>

956
00:52:44,313 --> 00:52:46,065
<i>-Oh, a lot...
-That's the next question.</i>

write everything down.</i>

967

ADVOCATE GENERAL:
Bon.

968
00:53:10,089 --> 00:53:11,632
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
Do you confirm this is

969
00:53:11,716 --> 00:53:13,593
your interview with Ms. Voyter?

970
00:53:13,926 --> 00:53:15,052
Yes.

971
00:53:15,136 --> 00:53:18,556
She refuses to talk about herself,
yet that's why you came.

972
00:53:18,848 --> 00:53:21,684
-ZOE: I came to talk about her work.
-Yes, yes.

973
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:24,687
Right, but by constantly
changing the subject,

974
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,231
what was she looking for,
do you suppose?

975
00:53:27,982 --> 00:53:31,027
ZOE: We can hear it.
She asks about me.

976
00:53:31,736 --> 00:53:35,823
She seemed to enjoy talking
about me more than herself.

977
00:53:36,741 --> 00:53:38,951
Was she inciting you
to talk about yourself?

978
00:53:39,744 --> 00:53:40,745
ZOE: Inciting...

979
00:53:41,662 --> 00:53:43,748
No, I wouldn't say that.

980
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:46,334
She wasn't manipulative,
just relaxed.

981
00:53:46,417 --> 00:53:50,004
It felt natural.
She seemed to enjoy the conversation.

982
00:53:50,087 --> 00:53:54,342
You say "relaxed."
We hear her serve you wine at 1:45.

983
00:53:54,425 --> 00:53:56,969
Had she been drinking
before you arrived?

984
00:53:57,762 --> 00:53:58,679
ZOE: I think so.

985
00:53:58,763 --> 00:54:01,891
Would you say she did her utmost

986
00:54:01,974 --> 00:54:03,392
to make you comfortable,

987
00:54:03,476 --> 00:54:05,561
more than you might've expected

988
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:08,272
when interviewing a writer?

989
00:54:08,356 --> 00:54:10,858
I wouldn't say that, no.

990
00:54:11,108 --> 00:54:14,195
It seemed like Sandra... Ms. Voyter,

991
00:54:14,278 --> 00:54:17,281
needed to escape, to decompress.

992
00:54:17,365 --> 00:54:18,533
-ADVOCATE GENERAL: Escape?
-Oui.

993
00:54:18,616 --> 00:54:22,245
Did you know that Sandra,
as you call her, was bisexual?

994
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:24,997
ZOE: No.

995
00:54:25,081 --> 00:54:26,874
Did you sense it?

996
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:27,959
ZOE: No.

997
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,797
Hearing the conversation now,
with hindsight,

998
00:54:33,756 --> 00:54:35,800
would you call it seduction?

999
00:54:37,385 --> 00:54:41,389
I felt, and she told me herself,
that she didn't have

1000
00:54:41,472 --> 00:54:45,184
much of a social life
or many chances to talk

1001
00:54:45,268 --> 00:54:46,435
to new people.

1002
00:54:46,686 --> 00:54:50,815
I suppose you could call that
a form of seduction.

1003
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:55,236
The court needs to know
if you would call it that.

1004
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:57,530
Seduction means several things.

1005
00:54:57,613 --> 00:55:00,408
But the word seduction
always implies some...

1006
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:01,868
seduction.

1007
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:03,286
VINCENT:
The witness's answer

1008
00:55:03,536 --> 00:55:07,331
is clear enough,
as to what she means by seduction.

1009
00:55:07,415 --> 00:55:10,960
Ms. Voyter kept expressing
her interest in you.

1010
00:55:11,043 --> 00:55:13,588
She wanted to do the interview
in Grenoble.

1011
00:55:14,338 --> 00:55:15,464
Didn't you sense...

1012
00:55:15,548 --> 00:55:17,091
VINCENT:
She answered that question.

1013
00:55:17,175 --> 00:55:20,011
JUSTICE MINISTER: Not very clearly.
Please answer, Miss Solidor.

1014
00:55:20,094 --> 00:55:21,804
ZOE: Could you call me Ms.?

1015
00:55:22,388 --> 00:55:24,974
I dislike being reduced
to a marital status.

1016
00:55:25,057 --> 00:55:27,143
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Of course. That wasn't my intention.

1017
00:55:27,226 --> 00:55:29,937
-(Advocate General chuckles)
-I didn't feel seduced in the moment.

1018
00:55:30,021 --> 00:55:32,648
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
So you did wonder afterwards?

1019
00:55:33,733 --> 00:55:36,277
I found it atypical, nothing more.

1020
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,448
How did you interpret the song
Samuel Maleski played?

1021
00:55:41,657 --> 00:55:43,743
I felt tension around the noise.

1022
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:48,206
Samuel Maleski imposing
his presence without showing himself.

1023
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:50,249
And Sandra's reaction...

1024
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:51,834
What was her reaction?

1025
00:55:53,961 --> 00:55:55,838
She was a bit annoyed.

1026
00:55:56,547 --> 00:55:59,300
And when the song started over?

1027
00:55:59,717 --> 00:56:01,594
He was playing it on a loop.

1028
00:56:01,677 --> 00:56:02,637
(laughs) Right.

1029
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,180
Clearly...

1030
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:05,932
good deduction.

1031
00:56:06,015 --> 00:56:09,018
But how did it feel to you
in the moment?

1032
00:56:09,685 --> 00:56:11,312
ZOE:
It added to the strangeness.

1033
00:56:12,063 --> 00:56:14,565
I felt my presence was less...

1034
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:17,527
It was less relaxed.

1035
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,362
So you clearly felt tension.

1036
00:56:19,445 --> 00:56:22,281
-VINCENT: You're nitpicking.
-No, just clarifying.

1037
00:56:22,365 --> 00:56:23,991
Did you feel tension?

1038
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:25,326
ZOE: Yes.

1039
00:56:25,409 --> 00:56:30,665
Did you feel that Mr. Maleski,
by playing that music,

1040
00:56:30,748 --> 00:56:34,085
wanted to disrupt, or interrupt,
your interview?

1041
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,963
That was my first thought, yes.

1042
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:42,176
But it's hard to read the intentions
of someone you can't see.

1043
00:56:42,802 --> 00:56:44,637
That's what they pay me for!

1044
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,389
(gallery laughs)

1045
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:47,765
Sandra Voyter,

1046
00:56:48,266 --> 00:56:51,519
you sought a connection
to divert the interview.

1047
00:56:51,602 --> 00:56:53,020
Correct?

1048
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:54,730
That's a leading question.

1049
00:56:54,814 --> 00:56:56,524
There was no seduction.

1050
00:56:56,858 --> 00:56:58,985
ADVOCATE GENERAL: My question
concerns your connection.

1051
00:56:59,068 --> 00:57:03,239
In the recording you're chummy,
laughing, drinking wine.

1052
00:57:03,322 --> 00:57:06,409
Were you seeking escape
from a difficult home life

1053
00:57:06,492 --> 00:57:08,661
by connecting
with this young woman?

1054
00:57:08,744 --> 00:57:11,330
NOUR: Ms. Voyter
did not initiate the meeting.

1055
00:57:11,581 --> 00:57:13,499
Please answer, Ms. Voyter.

1056
00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:15,251
Uh...

1057
00:57:15,334 --> 00:57:17,545
Yes, I found her surprising.

1058
00:57:17,837 --> 00:57:20,756
I hadn't seen anyone new
in a while.

1059
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,217
And yes, I needed a drink.

1060
00:57:23,301 --> 00:57:27,680
This person was intelligent
and nice, nothing more.

1061
00:57:28,347 --> 00:57:32,268
That interview was hardly enough
to base a thesis on!

1062
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:34,353
VINCENT:
She can have a laugh with a student

1063
00:57:34,437 --> 00:57:36,772
whose questions don't thrill her.

1064
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:40,234
Would you say the music
Mr. Maleski played

1065
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:42,403
so aggressively

1066
00:57:42,486 --> 00:57:44,447
indicated he was jealous of you,

1067
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,866
or Miss... Ms. Solidor? Sorry.

1068
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:49,660
The music was a cover
of 50 Cent's "P.I.M.P.,"

1069
00:57:49,744 --> 00:57:52,079
a deeply misogynistic song.

1070
00:57:52,163 --> 00:57:54,040
It was an instrumental version.

1071
00:57:54,123 --> 00:57:55,583
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Answer, please.

1072
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:59,670
Could your husband's song choice
express his jealousy?

1073
00:57:59,754 --> 00:58:00,796
SANDRA:
I can answer.

1074
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:05,718
He often played that song.
I doubt it was intentional.

1075
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:09,972
He loved loud music, it relaxed him.

1076
00:58:11,641 --> 00:58:14,477
He had purposefully installed...

1077
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,770
(scoffs)

1078
00:58:15,853 --> 00:58:17,647
(in English)
How do you say "speaker," sorry?

1079
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,689
(Vincent translates "speaker")

1080
00:58:18,773 --> 00:58:21,359
(in French)
a powerful speaker... sorry.

1081
00:58:22,235 --> 00:58:24,362
He worked a lot, it was noisy...

1082
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:27,823
Ms. Solidor says
you ended the interview over that.

1083
00:58:27,907 --> 00:58:30,451
-Is that true?
-She never said that.

1084
00:58:30,535 --> 00:58:31,827
JUSTICE MINISTER:
If the defense

1085
00:58:32,453 --> 00:58:35,706
keeps reacting to every question,

1086
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:37,708
I'll be very irritated.

1087
00:58:38,835 --> 00:58:40,795
Ms. Voyter, answer the question.

1088
00:58:43,464 --> 00:58:46,175
The music was just very loud.

1089
00:58:46,259 --> 00:58:48,511
And when it started over,

1090
00:58:48,594 --> 00:58:51,639
I realized it wasn't going to stop.

1091
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:56,102
That made discussion difficult.

1092
00:58:57,436 --> 00:58:59,105
(stammers) So I...

1093
00:58:59,188 --> 00:59:00,940
I preferred to stop.

1094
00:59:01,274 --> 00:59:03,651
And I was tired, yes.

1095
00:59:03,734 --> 00:59:05,820
And I felt a bit...

1096
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:08,698
woozy, from the wine.

1097
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:13,202
Yet once alone, you didn't ask him
to explain his behavior?

1098
00:59:14,787 --> 00:59:17,081
As I said, it was habitual.

1099
00:59:17,164 --> 00:59:18,332
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
No. No.

1100
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:21,919
You entertaining
an attractive young woman

1101
00:59:22,003 --> 00:59:25,590
while he toiled upstairs
was neither habitual, nor neutral.

1102
00:59:25,673 --> 00:59:28,593
He knew you liked women.
You'd recently cheated.

1103
00:59:28,676 --> 00:59:30,428
VINCENT:
That's beside the point.

1104
00:59:30,511 --> 00:59:31,345
And sexist.

1105
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:33,139
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
I'd have said the same

1106
00:59:33,222 --> 00:59:34,557
if she were an attractive man.

1107
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,352
Excuse me,
but this couple's conflicts matter here.

1108
00:59:38,436 --> 00:59:41,355
The situation
is objectively quite strange.

1109
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:45,109
You say you went upstairs
to your room to work and sleep.

1110
00:59:45,193 --> 00:59:48,779
Right below the attic
with the deafening music.

1111
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:52,116
Music that had made
the interview impossible.

1112
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,619
In that big house,
you chose that spot?

1113
00:59:54,702 --> 00:59:58,414
Yes, that's where I work.
I always work in bed.

1114
00:59:59,665 --> 01:00:00,750
(Advocate General scoffs)

1115
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:02,335
-ADVOCATE GENERAL: When Samuel came...
-Pardon?

1116
01:00:02,418 --> 01:00:04,212
...to talk to you, you didn't complain?

1117
01:00:04,295 --> 01:00:07,298
Deafening music overhead
is hardly normal.

1118
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:11,093
I'm used to it, I don't mind.

1119
01:00:11,177 --> 01:00:14,013
I wanted to work,
I had my earplugs.

1120
01:00:14,096 --> 01:00:15,139
It was normal.

1121
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:18,100
I can work in any situation.

1122
01:00:18,184 --> 01:00:20,895
You said you were tired,
woozy from the wine.

1123
01:00:20,978 --> 01:00:23,022
Yet you wanted to work?

1124
01:00:23,105 --> 01:00:24,023
Yes.

1125
01:00:24,106 --> 01:00:25,942
And I did. Not for long.

1126
01:00:26,025 --> 01:00:27,777
A translation was due.

1127
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,238
I wanted to finish it before resting.

1128
01:00:30,655 --> 01:00:34,867
As I said, I can work
in any environment, any condition.

1129
01:00:34,951 --> 01:00:38,162
Apparently you can also rest
anywhere, anytime.

1130
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:40,373
So all was well with the world.

1131
01:00:45,461 --> 01:00:46,379
That's all.

1132
01:00:50,091 --> 01:00:51,425
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
No further questions.

1133
01:00:54,595 --> 01:00:56,848
JUDGE JANVIER (on recording):
<i>Daniel, that's not what you told us.</i>

1134
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:59,934
<i>Zoé Solidor saw you
leave the house after she left.</i>

1135
01:01:00,017 --> 01:01:03,312
<i>And your mom says
she spoke to your dad after that.</i>

1136
01:01:04,939 --> 01:01:06,107
DANIEL (on recording):
<i>I got mixed up.</i>

1137
01:01:06,983 --> 01:01:08,192
JUDGE:
<i>You got mixed up.</i>

1138
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,447
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Bon.

1139
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:16,784
Indeed there is a problem, Daniel.

1140
01:01:16,868 --> 01:01:17,910
Right?

1141
01:01:17,994 --> 01:01:20,705
You couldn't be two places at once.

1142
01:01:22,206 --> 01:01:24,542
DANIEL:
I think I went back inside.

1143
01:01:27,336 --> 01:01:31,507
What bothers me is how sure
you were before the reenactment.

1144
01:01:31,883 --> 01:01:34,177
You said in your statement:

1145
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,096
"Each piece of tape feels different.

1146
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,891
I wouldn't get it wrong."

1147
01:01:40,516 --> 01:01:43,269
And: "I was just below
the open window.

1148
01:01:43,352 --> 01:01:45,271
I know what I heard."

1149
01:01:45,354 --> 01:01:49,025
Then, during the reenactment,
you said something else entirely.

1150
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:50,568
How come?

1151
01:01:53,446 --> 01:01:56,490
I thought
I remembered where I was, but...

1152
01:01:58,993 --> 01:02:02,747
Maybe the shock of what
happened next got me mixed up.

1153
01:02:03,122 --> 01:02:05,333
VINCENT:
A psychiatrist who met with Daniel

1154
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:09,212
says emotional shock
may have altered some memories.

1155
01:02:09,712 --> 01:02:10,588
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
Of course.

1156
01:02:10,671 --> 01:02:13,508
Do you remember now
why you came back inside?

1157
01:02:15,718 --> 01:02:17,720
I think I must've forgotten...

1158
01:02:18,387 --> 01:02:20,014
my gloves or my phone.

1159
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:22,183
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
But you're not sure?

1160
01:02:23,726 --> 01:02:25,561
I don't remember exactly.

1161
01:02:25,645 --> 01:02:29,232
ADVOCATE GENERAL: So, you went
from absolute certainty to uncertainty

1162
01:02:29,315 --> 01:02:31,609
about your memories of that day.

1163
01:02:31,901 --> 01:02:33,945
VINCENT:
This is very problematic.

1164
01:02:34,028 --> 01:02:37,073
You're fixating on one detail
in his memory

1165
01:02:37,156 --> 01:02:39,700
to cast doubt
on his whole memory.

1166
01:02:40,117 --> 01:02:41,911
What do you want us to believe?

1167
01:02:41,994 --> 01:02:45,414
That shock may have turned
yelling into calm voices?

1168
01:02:45,498 --> 01:02:48,501
You insinuate
he lied to protect his mother.

1169
01:02:48,584 --> 01:02:49,544
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
No.

1170
01:02:50,253 --> 01:02:52,630
I'm merely signaling
the witness's doubts.

1171
01:02:52,713 --> 01:02:55,049
But we are entitled to wonder.

1172
01:02:55,132 --> 01:02:59,053
Daniel Maleski says he would leave
when his parents fought.

1173
01:02:59,136 --> 01:03:02,431
Whereas on that day,
he happens to go out

1174
01:03:02,515 --> 01:03:05,351
right when an argument
is likely to erupt.

1175
01:03:05,434 --> 01:03:07,353
Thus, he doesn't hear a thing.

1176
01:03:07,812 --> 01:03:10,523
I didn't happen to go out.
I fled the music.

1177
01:03:10,606 --> 01:03:14,694
VINCENT: And he's very precise
about what he heard.

1178
01:03:14,777 --> 01:03:16,445
He's never budged on that.

1179
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:20,324
The psychiatrist
and visual impairment expert

1180
01:03:20,408 --> 01:03:23,661
both observed
Daniel's excellent aural memory.

1181
01:03:25,705 --> 01:03:26,914
(dry chuckle)

1182
01:03:29,834 --> 01:03:33,337
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Clerk, please display

1183
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:35,923
the elements provided by Mr. Balard.

1184
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:39,927
We're listening.

1185
01:03:40,011 --> 01:03:43,639
EXPERT BALARD: The decisive element here
is the three blood spatters

1186
01:03:43,723 --> 01:03:45,141
on the woodshed,

1187
01:03:45,224 --> 01:03:47,852
as indicated on the sketch.

1188
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:52,023
-Can we zoom in on the woodshed?
-(mouse clicks)

1189
01:03:52,899 --> 01:03:56,819
Their shape is typical of spatter
projected from high above.

1190
01:03:56,903 --> 01:03:59,280
They are long and narrow.

1191
01:03:59,363 --> 01:04:04,202
The longest measures
four centimeters, which is a lot.

1192
01:04:04,285 --> 01:04:05,912
So, according to our tests,

1193
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:08,623
these spatters
could only have landed here

1194
01:04:08,706 --> 01:04:11,334
if Mr. Maleski
was struck on the head

1195
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:14,003
while on the 3rd floor balcony.

1196
01:04:14,795 --> 01:04:18,007
He would have
to have been leaning over the balcony,

1197
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:21,844
his head already quite far out
when the blow was struck,

1198
01:04:21,928 --> 01:04:24,639
for the spatter to land there.

1199
01:04:24,722 --> 01:04:26,599
No other explanation stands.

1200
01:04:26,682 --> 01:04:30,686
Did the violence of the blow
make Mr. Maleski fall?

1201
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,021
EXPERT BALARD:
Most likely,

1202
01:04:32,104 --> 01:04:35,608
it was the combination
of a violent blow

1203
01:04:35,691 --> 01:04:37,735
and a deliberate push.

1204
01:04:37,818 --> 01:04:41,864
Would you say the aggressor
was in a state of extreme anger,

1205
01:04:41,948 --> 01:04:45,701
to provoke a fall
after administering such a violent blow?

1206
01:04:45,785 --> 01:04:47,995
EXPERT BALARD:
A state of rage, I'd say.

1207
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:50,206
Hard to imagine anything less.

1208
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:54,085
Such states
can increase physical strength.

1209
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:02,510
(Vincent clears throat)

1210
01:05:05,429 --> 01:05:10,268
The guardrail is 1.2 meters high.

1211
01:05:10,351 --> 01:05:13,396
Comes up to about here.

1212
01:05:13,896 --> 01:05:16,649
Mr. Maleski was 1.82 meters tall

1213
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:18,651
and weighed 85 kilos.

1214
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:22,321
So, pushing him over that guardrail

1215
01:05:22,405 --> 01:05:26,242
would have required
a very deliberate push, right?

1216
01:05:26,325 --> 01:05:29,412
The entire act was very deliberate.

1217
01:05:29,495 --> 01:05:31,789
Such a blow is always intentional.

1218
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:34,083
What I mean by very deliberate  is...

1219
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:36,878
very coordinated. Methodical.

1220
01:05:37,128 --> 01:05:39,630
Based on his weight,
we can assume

1221
01:05:39,714 --> 01:05:43,259
it was necessary to lift his legs
to make him fall,

1222
01:05:43,342 --> 01:05:45,386
which hardly suggests rage.

1223
01:05:45,469 --> 01:05:47,346
Rage does not exclude will.

1224
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:51,601
And Mr. Maleski was probably
already off-balance.

1225
01:05:51,684 --> 01:05:53,352
He may have fallen

1226
01:05:53,436 --> 01:05:56,981
as much from the blow
as from his own unstable position.

1227
01:05:57,064 --> 01:05:59,859
As I said,
we have no material elements...

1228
01:05:59,942 --> 01:06:02,069
Except those three drops of blood.

1229
01:06:03,154 --> 01:06:08,201
Everything else must be speculated
to explain those drops, right?

1230
01:06:08,284 --> 01:06:11,704
EXPERT BALARD: Okay, but the only
explanation is the one I gave.

1231
01:06:11,787 --> 01:06:15,041
You gave us a theory,
not an explanation.

1232
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:16,876
Actually, two theories.

1233
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:20,046
With and without a deliberate push.

1234
01:06:20,755 --> 01:06:22,548
According to your theories,

1235
01:06:22,632 --> 01:06:24,759
what type of object was used?

1236
01:06:24,842 --> 01:06:27,386
EXPERT BALARD:
A heavy object, probably in metal

1237
01:06:27,637 --> 01:06:29,680
or dense wood,

1238
01:06:29,764 --> 01:06:32,433
and undoubtedly with a sharp edge.

1239
01:06:32,517 --> 01:06:36,145
Did you examine any such objects
found on the premises?

1240
01:06:36,229 --> 01:06:38,940
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
You know no weapon was found.

1241
01:06:39,023 --> 01:06:40,816
They're easily disposed of.

1242
01:06:41,442 --> 01:06:42,944
VINCENT:
No further questions.

1243
01:06:45,154 --> 01:06:48,074
EXPERT BOGAERT: Two possible
explanations for these three spatters.

1244
01:06:48,157 --> 01:06:52,370
Either they came from here,
after a violent blow.

1245
01:06:52,912 --> 01:06:55,831
Or they resulted when the skull

1246
01:06:55,915 --> 01:06:57,750
hit this roof ledge,

1247
01:06:57,834 --> 01:06:59,252
approximately here.

1248
01:06:59,585 --> 01:07:01,504
The first hypothesis is unlikely.

1249
01:07:01,587 --> 01:07:06,050
It's inconsistent with the shape
and movement of the spatters.

1250
01:07:07,009 --> 01:07:08,970
Focusing on the second hypothesis,

1251
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:12,807
we must take into account
the bounce caused by the impact

1252
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:14,225
on the roof ledge.

1253
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:18,229
I'll show you a video
of our in situ tests.

1254
01:07:23,734 --> 01:07:24,652
There.

1255
01:07:24,735 --> 01:07:28,364
As you can see
in our reenactment with a dummy,

1256
01:07:28,698 --> 01:07:31,909
such an impact
causes the body to turn abruptly.

1257
01:07:31,993 --> 01:07:35,454
And during that rollover, or spin,

1258
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:38,040
a fraction of a second after impact,

1259
01:07:38,124 --> 01:07:42,128
these three spatters are projected

1260
01:07:42,211 --> 01:07:43,671
<i>onto this surface.</i>

1261
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,177
The only valid explanation

1262
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,889
is that Mr. Maleski
fell from the attic window.

1263
01:07:52,971 --> 01:07:54,390
I believe it's the only way

1264
01:07:54,473 --> 01:07:56,767
he could've bounced off the roof,

1265
01:07:57,225 --> 01:07:58,895
and sustained such an injury.

1266
01:07:58,978 --> 01:08:01,439
You use the cautious qualifier
"I believe."

1267
01:08:01,522 --> 01:08:02,982
So it's your opinion.

1268
01:08:03,399 --> 01:08:06,068
NOUR: How do you explain
the lack of DNA or trace tissue

1269
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:09,738
at the point of impact,
or "bounce" as you call it?

1270
01:08:10,238 --> 01:08:11,908
I'll show you.

1271
01:08:11,991 --> 01:08:14,243
This is a test we carried out

1272
01:08:14,327 --> 01:08:16,203
under comparable conditions.

1273
01:08:16,287 --> 01:08:17,371
Voilà.

1274
01:08:17,455 --> 01:08:19,832
At the time of the incident,
there was a layer of ice

1275
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:22,585
underneath a thick layer of snow.

1276
01:08:23,794 --> 01:08:27,048
We see the snow melting
in acceleration.

1277
01:08:27,131 --> 01:08:28,549
And we can see,

1278
01:08:28,633 --> 01:08:32,553
over the span of 1 hour
and 50 minutes, that the runoff

1279
01:08:33,054 --> 01:08:36,765
takes with it all residue
embedded at the point of impact.

1280
01:08:36,849 --> 01:08:38,559
It ends up with the blood

1281
01:08:38,643 --> 01:08:39,810
down here.

1282
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:43,606
You call the violent blow
hypothesis "improbable."

1283
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:45,816
Would you call it impossible?

1284
01:08:46,943 --> 01:08:48,903
No, but highly improbable.

1285
01:08:48,986 --> 01:08:50,904
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
Meaning it is possible.

1286
01:08:50,988 --> 01:08:53,950
As it's possible
I'll be president someday.

1287
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:55,493
-(gallery murmuring)
-I know the definition.

1288
01:08:55,576 --> 01:08:57,118
EXPERT BOGAERT:
It's improbable for a reason.

1289
01:08:57,203 --> 01:09:00,497
In your hypothesis,
in order to explain the angle

1290
01:09:00,581 --> 01:09:02,082
of these three spatters,

1291
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:05,627
we have to imagine
that Mr. Maleski's head

1292
01:09:05,711 --> 01:09:09,340
was leaning way out,
around 80 cm past the guardrail.

1293
01:09:09,423 --> 01:09:12,510
This implies the aggressor
forced him

1294
01:09:12,593 --> 01:09:14,595
to lean backwards over the void,

1295
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:17,723
shoving him against the guardrail,

1296
01:09:17,807 --> 01:09:20,810
his entire torso pitched backwards.

1297
01:09:21,143 --> 01:09:26,023
The aggressor would have
to be leaning very far out

1298
01:09:26,107 --> 01:09:28,149
while holding a heavy object

1299
01:09:28,234 --> 01:09:31,487
and striking the victim
with powerful momentum.

1300
01:09:31,571 --> 01:09:32,947
All these elements,

1301
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:35,992
in addition to
the defendant's body mass,

1302
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:38,327
make this hypothesis
highly improbable.

1303
01:09:38,411 --> 01:09:39,579
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
But not impossible.

1304
01:09:39,662 --> 01:09:41,831
(gallery murmuring)

1305
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,211
Okay. Listen, Daniel,
I asked to see you because...

1306
01:09:47,295 --> 01:09:50,631
I know you have
a vested interest in this case.

1307
01:09:50,715 --> 01:09:53,509
I've allowed you
to attend the trial so far.

1308
01:09:53,593 --> 01:09:55,094
But tomorrow will be

1309
01:09:55,178 --> 01:09:57,054
far more complicated.

1310
01:09:57,138 --> 01:10:00,016
We'll be covering
some disturbing details,

1311
01:10:00,099 --> 01:10:02,602
so I've decided
you won't be attending.

1312
01:10:03,728 --> 01:10:05,563
I think I can hear anything.

1313
01:10:05,646 --> 01:10:06,606
JUSTICE MINISTER:
What?

1314
01:10:06,689 --> 01:10:08,524
I think I can hear anything.

1315
01:10:08,941 --> 01:10:10,818
-Yeah?
-I'm prepared.

1316
01:10:10,902 --> 01:10:14,071
JUSTICE MINISTER: You can hear it,
but can you handle it?

1317
01:10:14,155 --> 01:10:15,823
We have a job to do.

1318
01:10:15,907 --> 01:10:19,577
We need to be able to work...
with serenity.

1319
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,370
I've never disrupted the trial.

1320
01:10:21,454 --> 01:10:23,206
JUSTICE MINISTER (chuckles):
Disrupted...

1321
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:25,166
That's not the point.

1322
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:29,629
We need to be able
to evoke the facts bluntly.

1323
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,049
We have to address everything,

1324
01:10:33,132 --> 01:10:35,510
without fear of hurting you.

1325
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:39,972
I've already been hurt.

1326
01:10:41,682 --> 01:10:43,893
And that's why I need...

1327
01:10:45,269 --> 01:10:47,522
to hear, so I can get past it.

1328
01:10:47,605 --> 01:10:49,815
JUSTICE MINISTER:
The trial is not about you hearing.

1329
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:52,360
It's about establishing the truth,

1330
01:10:52,443 --> 01:10:54,654
without being forced
to censor ourselves.

1331
01:10:54,737 --> 01:10:58,157
(scoffs) When has anyone
censored themselves?

1332
01:10:59,325 --> 01:11:01,577
Even if you forbid me to come,

1333
01:11:02,411 --> 01:11:05,039
I'll find out.
I'll know what happened

1334
01:11:05,122 --> 01:11:06,958
from TV, radio, Internet.

1335
01:11:07,834 --> 01:11:09,460
I'll be obsessed.

1336
01:11:16,551 --> 01:11:21,430
(people moving about and settling in)

1337
01:11:21,514 --> 01:11:23,516
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
Ms. Voyter, you claim

1338
01:11:23,599 --> 01:11:26,561
your husband attempted suicide
six months before he died.

1339
01:11:27,311 --> 01:11:30,565
You remembered late,
which is quite surprising.

1340
01:11:30,648 --> 01:11:33,526
Can you describe
the episode in detail?

1341
01:11:33,609 --> 01:11:34,735
SANDRA: Oui.

1342
01:11:40,783 --> 01:11:45,288
It happened a few weeks
after he stopped his medication.

1343
01:11:46,414 --> 01:11:48,916
I found him lying on the floor...

1344
01:11:49,959 --> 01:11:52,295
early in the morning, in his room.

1345
01:11:54,046 --> 01:11:55,214
He'd...

1346
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:57,341
had a lot to drink...

1347
01:11:58,092 --> 01:12:00,803
the night before, and passed out.

1348
01:12:02,388 --> 01:12:05,808
He'd vomited,
and in the vomit, I saw aspirin.

1349
01:12:06,684 --> 01:12:10,062
The pills had nearly dissolved.

1350
01:12:12,148 --> 01:12:14,942
<i>At first I didn't understand
what it was.</i>

1351
01:12:15,693 --> 01:12:18,154
<i>But later, I found...</i>

1352
01:12:18,863 --> 01:12:21,657
<i>empty blister packs
in the kitchen garbage.</i>

1353
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:25,411
I cleaned it all up
and put him in bed.

1354
01:12:26,037 --> 01:12:27,330
Later,

1355
01:12:27,413 --> 01:12:29,165
when he felt better,

1356
01:12:29,248 --> 01:12:31,250
he didn't want to discuss it.

1357
01:12:31,334 --> 01:12:34,128
He just said
he'd stopped his meds too soon.

1358
01:12:34,212 --> 01:12:37,590
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Mm. You had separate bedrooms?

1359
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:42,178
It was his office,
and he usually slept there, yes.

1360
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:44,680
JUSTICE MINISTER:
I see.

1361
01:12:44,764 --> 01:12:48,226
What made you
go into his room so early?

1362
01:12:48,309 --> 01:12:50,937
I wake up very early.
He did too, sometimes.

1363
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:54,273
We occasionally spent that time
together, talking.

1364
01:12:54,357 --> 01:12:55,942
JUSTICE MINISTER:
At six in the morning?

1365
01:12:56,025 --> 01:12:58,486
Yes, if I saw the light on.

1366
01:12:59,278 --> 01:13:02,448
We'd stopped sharing a bed,
but we were very close.

1367
01:13:02,532 --> 01:13:04,367
I would often...

1368
01:13:05,451 --> 01:13:08,454
finish the night with him,
in the office bed.

1369
01:13:09,956 --> 01:13:11,958
I'd gone down to make coffee.

1370
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:15,044
I saw his door was ajar, and...

1371
01:13:15,586 --> 01:13:17,630
I saw him lying on the floor.

1372
01:13:18,047 --> 01:13:20,216
JUSTICE MINISTER:
No one else witnessed that?

1373
01:13:20,299 --> 01:13:21,551
No.

1374
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:24,053
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Thank you, you may sit down.

1375
01:13:26,389 --> 01:13:27,765
Did you know that?

1376
01:13:27,849 --> 01:13:28,766
DANIEL: No.

1377
01:13:29,559 --> 01:13:31,310
Which antidepressant
did you prescribe?

1378
01:13:31,394 --> 01:13:33,187
JAMMAL:
Escitalopram, 20 mg per day.

1379
01:13:33,437 --> 01:13:35,481
-Was it his choice to stop?
-Yes.

1380
01:13:35,898 --> 01:13:39,193
About seven months before he died
he wanted to wean off.

1381
01:13:39,277 --> 01:13:43,155
I recommended a tapering plan
with weekly check-ins.

1382
01:13:43,239 --> 01:13:44,907
Any suicidal ideation?

1383
01:13:45,491 --> 01:13:47,493
No, Samuel wasn't depressive.

1384
01:13:47,577 --> 01:13:50,830
I'd prescribed Escitalopram
as an emotional shield

1385
01:13:50,913 --> 01:13:54,375
to help him cope
after his son's accident.

1386
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:58,921
Can sudden withdrawal from
a low dose trigger a suicide attempt?

1387
01:13:59,755 --> 01:14:02,091
Anything's possible in theory,

1388
01:14:02,175 --> 01:14:06,512
but why would he have asked me
to help him wean off,

1389
01:14:06,596 --> 01:14:09,640
then stop behind my back?
Makes no sense.

1390
01:14:09,724 --> 01:14:12,685
And no mention of it
in our weekly sessions?

1391
01:14:13,644 --> 01:14:14,729
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
Bon.

1392
01:14:25,615 --> 01:14:28,951
Have you ever had
a patient commit suicide,

1393
01:14:29,035 --> 01:14:30,536
or attempt suicide?

1394
01:14:30,828 --> 01:14:33,164
In French, "committing suicide"

1395
01:14:33,247 --> 01:14:37,001
means both trying and succeeding.

1396
01:14:37,084 --> 01:14:38,169
It's the action.

1397
01:14:38,252 --> 01:14:39,795
Thanks for the language lesson.

1398
01:14:39,879 --> 01:14:41,881
No patient has committed suicide.

1399
01:14:41,964 --> 01:14:43,841
Aside from Mr. Maleski,

1400
01:14:43,925 --> 01:14:46,802
since we're here
to rule on the question.

1401
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,596
In any case,

1402
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:51,557
we can't consider you
an expert on suicide,

1403
01:14:51,641 --> 01:14:52,975
failed or successful.

1404
01:14:53,559 --> 01:14:57,063
You said your husband
refused to discuss it with you,

1405
01:14:57,146 --> 01:14:58,981
or anyone else, apparently.

1406
01:14:59,065 --> 01:15:00,358
Why, do you think?

1407
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:04,487
SANDRA:
Uh, because he was ashamed.

1408
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,822
He had a lot of...

1409
01:15:10,284 --> 01:15:11,410
Um...

1410
01:15:11,494 --> 01:15:12,495
(in English)
It's too complicated.

1411
01:15:12,578 --> 01:15:13,955
Can I change
the language, please?

1412
01:15:15,373 --> 01:15:16,457
SANDRA (in French):
Thanks.

1413
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:18,334
Um...

1414
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:19,961
SANDRA (in English): Yeah, I think
because he was ashamed.

1415
01:15:20,044 --> 01:15:21,712
(translator whispering)

1416
01:15:21,796 --> 01:15:24,966
-Samuel had a lot of issues with shame.
-(translation playing over earbud)

1417
01:15:25,049 --> 01:15:27,051
It's complicated, there were...

1418
01:15:27,134 --> 01:15:28,803
He, uh...

1419
01:15:28,886 --> 01:15:30,429
He was, uh, frustrated

1420
01:15:30,513 --> 01:15:31,848
with teaching in the first place,

1421
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:33,099
it had become a burden.

1422
01:15:34,183 --> 01:15:36,018
And he wanted to write.

1423
01:15:36,102 --> 01:15:38,855
Um, he'd been working
on a novel for years,

1424
01:15:38,938 --> 01:15:41,315
before and after
Daniel's accident.

1425
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:44,235
Um, I read everything
he wrote back then,

1426
01:15:44,318 --> 01:15:46,279
and I thought it was really good
and I told him so,

1427
01:15:46,362 --> 01:15:49,198
but from one day
to another, he just...

1428
01:15:49,282 --> 01:15:50,283
couldn't do it anymore.

1429
01:15:50,366 --> 01:15:53,369
He just stopped and, uh...

1430
01:15:53,452 --> 01:15:55,496
it made him feel like a coward.

1431
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:59,876
He-- He would belittle
himself and, um...

1432
01:15:59,959 --> 01:16:02,837
He ended up convincing himself
that he could not write

1433
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:06,048
because of his dependency
on the medication,

1434
01:16:06,132 --> 01:16:08,009
and he wanted
to free himself of that.

1435
01:16:08,092 --> 01:16:10,553
-And he could not of course...
-(Jammal speaking in French)

1436
01:16:10,636 --> 01:16:12,263
-I'm sorry, I'm not finished.
-(Jammal stops)

1437
01:16:12,346 --> 01:16:14,640
He could not talk about
the suicide attempt

1438
01:16:14,724 --> 01:16:18,603
because his feelings of failure
were just too painful. And...

1439
01:16:18,686 --> 01:16:19,854
JAMMAL (in French):
He never spoke of that.

1440
01:16:19,937 --> 01:16:21,814
-...it was all a--
-JAMMAL: Not once.

1441
01:16:21,898 --> 01:16:23,983
No, he blamed you for getting him
hooked on the pills

1442
01:16:24,066 --> 01:16:26,903
from the very first session,
and it drove him mad...

1443
01:16:26,986 --> 01:16:28,571
(in French)
He and I decided together.

1444
01:16:28,654 --> 01:16:32,158
You can't deny you're at the center
of this equation.

1445
01:16:32,575 --> 01:16:36,078
Samuel came to see me
because he felt guilty,

1446
01:16:36,162 --> 01:16:38,915
but mostly because you blamed him.

1447
01:16:38,998 --> 01:16:41,501
He described your behavior

1448
01:16:41,584 --> 01:16:43,669
as quite castrating.

1449
01:16:44,086 --> 01:16:46,047
You made him pay

1450
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,257
for the accident

1451
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:51,844
by forcing him to give up
what mattered most to him:

1452
01:16:51,928 --> 01:16:52,970
writing.

1453
01:16:53,804 --> 01:16:57,350
You put him on
an emotional rollercoaster.

1454
01:16:57,433 --> 01:16:59,602
On the one hand, it's true,

1455
01:16:59,685 --> 01:17:02,772
you encouraged him to write,
wanted him to succeed.

1456
01:17:02,855 --> 01:17:06,359
But if he had,
it would've been unbearable for you.

1457
01:17:06,442 --> 01:17:09,278
That's the problem.
It may have been subconscious.

1458
01:17:10,446 --> 01:17:13,866
All the material
and psychological burdens

1459
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:16,577
resulting from the accident
were his to bear.

1460
01:17:16,661 --> 01:17:19,664
It's as though you said,
"This is your problem.

1461
01:17:19,747 --> 01:17:21,832
"You're responsible. Deal with it."

1462
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:24,836
"I want to free myself
from that, to write."

1463
01:17:24,919 --> 01:17:26,587
Material burdens

1464
01:17:26,671 --> 01:17:29,882
were managed by Ms. Voyter
as much as her husband.

1465
01:17:29,966 --> 01:17:33,511
We have their bank statements,
receipts, etc.

1466
01:17:33,594 --> 01:17:36,305
I'm also talking about
the emotional load.

1467
01:17:36,389 --> 01:17:39,267
Responsibilities, sense of purpose,

1468
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:41,060
anxiety.

1469
01:17:41,143 --> 01:17:45,648
In those areas,
Samuel felt an unbearable imbalance.

1470
01:17:45,731 --> 01:17:48,192
So what, your patients
tell you is the truth?

1471
01:17:48,276 --> 01:17:50,486
As a psychoanalyst,

1472
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:53,364
you never wondered
whether Samuel Maleski

1473
01:17:53,447 --> 01:17:57,243
might've needed to imagine
an unbearable imbalance

1474
01:17:57,326 --> 01:17:59,412
to prevent himself from writing?

1475
01:17:59,495 --> 01:18:03,624
After a while, I can tell
what's real and what isn't.

1476
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:04,959
VINCENT:
Lucky you.

1477
01:18:05,042 --> 01:18:06,961
(in English) I'm sorry
to interrupt, I'm sorry.

1478
01:18:07,044 --> 01:18:11,507
But... I don't know,
you, you come here,

1479
01:18:11,591 --> 01:18:13,551
okay, with your,
maybe your opinion,

1480
01:18:13,634 --> 01:18:18,222
and you tell me who Samuel was,

1481
01:18:18,306 --> 01:18:20,016
and what we were going through...

1482
01:18:20,099 --> 01:18:22,685
But what you say is just a...

1483
01:18:22,768 --> 01:18:24,353
it is just...

1484
01:18:24,437 --> 01:18:28,482
a little part of the whole
situation, you know?

1485
01:18:29,734 --> 01:18:31,527
I mean, sometimes...

1486
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:36,032
Sometimes a couple
is kind of a chaos.

1487
01:18:36,115 --> 01:18:38,826
And everybody is lost. No?

1488
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:40,411
And sometimes we fight together

1489
01:18:40,494 --> 01:18:41,829
and sometimes we fight alone

1490
01:18:41,913 --> 01:18:44,373
and sometimes we fight
against each other,

1491
01:18:44,457 --> 01:18:46,417
that happens, and I think

1492
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:49,253
it's possible that Samuel needed

1493
01:18:49,337 --> 01:18:52,548
to see things the way
you describe them, but...

1494
01:18:52,632 --> 01:18:53,758
(scoffs)

1495
01:18:53,841 --> 01:18:55,927
if-- if I'd been seeing a therapist,

1496
01:18:56,010 --> 01:18:57,553
he could stand here too

1497
01:18:57,637 --> 01:18:59,722
and say very ugly things
about Samuel.

1498
01:18:59,805 --> 01:19:02,475
But would those things be true?

1499
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:05,353
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
Madame Voyter...

1500
01:19:10,942 --> 01:19:14,737
(in French) Did you resent your husband
after your son's accident?

1501
01:19:18,741 --> 01:19:20,368
(in English)
We were both dealing

1502
01:19:20,451 --> 01:19:24,038
with very different emotions
at that time.

1503
01:19:25,623 --> 01:19:27,166
(in French)
Yes or no?

1504
01:19:30,044 --> 01:19:31,838
(in English)
Yes, for a few days,

1505
01:19:31,921 --> 01:19:33,172
Daniel was on his watch--

1506
01:19:33,256 --> 01:19:34,715
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
A few days?

1507
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:38,261
-Your son practically lost his sight...
-(Sandra clears throat)

1508
01:19:38,344 --> 01:19:40,805
and you only resented him
for a few days?

1509
01:19:42,014 --> 01:19:43,391
(in English)
Yeah, about his responsibility

1510
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:47,019
for the accident, yes, of course.

1511
01:19:48,354 --> 01:19:50,815
I mean, maybe, the doctor earlier

1512
01:19:50,898 --> 01:19:53,526
said something about
a tragic situation, I...

1513
01:19:53,609 --> 01:19:57,154
I immediately refused
to see it that way.

1514
01:19:57,238 --> 01:20:00,283
I never saw Daniel as handicapped.

1515
01:20:00,366 --> 01:20:01,367
You know?

1516
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:02,910
I-- I wanted to protect him

1517
01:20:02,994 --> 01:20:04,245
from that perception.

1518
01:20:04,328 --> 01:20:06,455
Because as soon as you mark
a child that way,

1519
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:09,166
you condemn him to not, to not...

1520
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:11,085
see his life as his own,

1521
01:20:11,169 --> 01:20:12,837
whereas, he should feel

1522
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:13,880
that it's his best life,

1523
01:20:13,963 --> 01:20:15,464
because it's
the only life he's got,

1524
01:20:15,548 --> 01:20:17,550
it is his own.

1525
01:20:17,633 --> 01:20:20,511
He... He reads books,

1526
01:20:20,595 --> 01:20:23,764
he goes on social media
like any other kid,

1527
01:20:23,848 --> 01:20:26,350
he plays the piano, he dreams,

1528
01:20:26,434 --> 01:20:27,435
he cries, he laughs...

1529
01:20:27,518 --> 01:20:30,229
He's a, he's a very lively kid.

1530
01:20:30,313 --> 01:20:32,440
He's okay!

1531
01:20:32,523 --> 01:20:33,566
Yeah?

1532
01:20:35,776 --> 01:20:37,236
So perhaps...

1533
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,697
yeah, I...

1534
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,324
I resented Samuel

1535
01:20:41,407 --> 01:20:44,118
for projecting his own pain
onto Daniel, yes.

1536
01:20:47,079 --> 01:20:48,039
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
Thank you.

1537
01:20:56,088 --> 01:20:57,089
(dry chuckle)

1538
01:21:07,016 --> 01:21:08,726
(Sandra sniffs)

1539
01:21:08,809 --> 01:21:10,228
SANDRA (in English):
I want to drink all night.

1540
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:13,606
VINCENT (in English):
Yeah, same.

1541
01:21:13,689 --> 01:21:16,859
I will drink, to forget.

1542
01:21:16,943 --> 01:21:17,985
Oh, come on!

1543
01:21:18,069 --> 01:21:18,986
You're the only lawyer...

1544
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:22,198
(both laughing)

1545
01:21:22,281 --> 01:21:23,574
VINCENT:
Okay, once again.

1546
01:21:23,658 --> 01:21:26,369
No, you're really
the only lawyer I know.

1547
01:21:27,745 --> 01:21:29,121
Is it a great reason for placing

1548
01:21:29,205 --> 01:21:31,374
your life in someone's hands?

1549
01:21:31,457 --> 01:21:32,458
Is it?

1550
01:21:32,542 --> 01:21:34,252
No, but you're good too, right?

1551
01:21:34,335 --> 01:21:35,711
-VINCENT: Ah? Yeah?
-Aren't you? You're good.

1552
01:21:35,795 --> 01:21:37,463
-I don't know.
-Oh, come on!

1553
01:21:37,547 --> 01:21:38,923
(chuckles)

1554
01:21:39,006 --> 01:21:40,591
You look like a dog.

1555
01:21:40,675 --> 01:21:41,843
(both laugh)

1556
01:21:41,926 --> 01:21:43,678
-VINCENT: Oh, I'm-- No, no.
-What, excuse me?

1557
01:21:43,761 --> 01:21:46,097
A beautiful dog.
You know, the...

1558
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:48,391
How do you say?
The... un basset?

1559
01:21:48,474 --> 01:21:50,184
Basset? Basset? You say that?

1560
01:21:50,268 --> 01:21:51,811
SANDRA:
It's funny you say that.

1561
01:21:51,894 --> 01:21:54,856
I can't trust someone if I can't
put an animal's head on them.

1562
01:21:54,939 --> 01:21:57,066
Really? So, what am I?

1563
01:21:58,776 --> 01:22:01,195
SANDRA:
Um, I'm not sure yet.

1564
01:22:02,989 --> 01:22:05,032
-What?
-I don't know.

1565
01:22:05,116 --> 01:22:07,368
-After all this time?
-SANDRA: Mmm.

1566
01:22:07,451 --> 01:22:08,828
You still don't know.

1567
01:22:11,289 --> 01:22:12,290
Okay.

1568
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:17,128
(speaks French)

1569
01:22:18,087 --> 01:22:19,088
(Vincent chuckles)

1570
01:22:20,673 --> 01:22:21,924
SANDRA: Vincent?

1571
01:22:22,008 --> 01:22:22,967
Sandra?

1572
01:22:24,343 --> 01:22:25,261
SANDRA:
Do you...

1573
01:22:25,344 --> 01:22:26,888
Do you remember me
from before?

1574
01:22:26,971 --> 01:22:28,890
When we first met?

1575
01:22:28,973 --> 01:22:30,641
Yes, I do, of course.

1576
01:22:30,725 --> 01:22:32,435
I don't. What was I like?

1577
01:22:34,812 --> 01:22:36,606
VINCENT:
You were...

1578
01:22:36,689 --> 01:22:41,027
a bit lost,
as I can remember, and...

1579
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:44,071
lonely, and...

1580
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:46,490
ambitious.

1581
01:22:47,825 --> 01:22:50,036
And I was hopelessly in love.

1582
01:22:50,119 --> 01:22:51,412
(Vincent chuckles)

1583
01:22:58,252 --> 01:23:00,087
Can't remember a thing.

1584
01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:04,383
VINCENT: Okay. Hmm.

1585
01:23:11,766 --> 01:23:12,850
SANDRA:
But I'm innocent.

1586
01:23:12,934 --> 01:23:14,143
You know that, right?

1587
01:23:14,227 --> 01:23:15,853
Yes.

1588
01:23:15,937 --> 01:23:17,522
SANDRA:
I mean, really.

1589
01:23:20,066 --> 01:23:22,318
-VINCENT: Yes.
-I don't know what you're thinking really.

1590
01:23:24,403 --> 01:23:28,449
I think a lot of things
I don't tell you.

1591
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:29,992
Otherwise, you'd fire me right now.

1592
01:23:30,076 --> 01:23:31,202
SANDRA:
No, no, no, Vincent.

1593
01:23:31,285 --> 01:23:33,204
In your head, you're thinking,

1594
01:23:33,287 --> 01:23:35,164
aren't you, because sometimes,
when you look at me,

1595
01:23:35,248 --> 01:23:36,999
just like right now,

1596
01:23:37,083 --> 01:23:38,918
I can feel
that you are judging me.

1597
01:23:40,294 --> 01:23:42,588
I don't know what you think.

1598
01:23:42,672 --> 01:23:45,424
VINCENT:
Sandra, I believe you.

1599
01:23:45,508 --> 01:23:46,634
I'm not judging you.

1600
01:24:07,488 --> 01:24:09,031
SANDRA (whispering):
My love...

1601
01:24:10,449 --> 01:24:12,368
I just want you to know one thing.

1602
01:24:12,451 --> 01:24:15,580
I'm not... I am not that, that...

1603
01:24:15,663 --> 01:24:18,207
I'm not that monster, you know?

1604
01:24:18,291 --> 01:24:21,002
Everything you hear in the trial,

1605
01:24:21,085 --> 01:24:23,087
uh, it's just...

1606
01:24:24,839 --> 01:24:27,466
It's twisted, you know?

1607
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:30,678
And it wasn't
like that, you know.

1608
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:32,847
Uh, your father...

1609
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:35,600
Your father was my soul mate...

1610
01:24:35,683 --> 01:24:38,311
We chose each other
and I loved him...

1611
01:24:41,898 --> 01:24:43,566
But how do you prove that?

1612
01:24:49,697 --> 01:24:51,407
I just wish you would be shielded

1613
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:53,534
from all this, you know,
that you could do...

1614
01:24:54,827 --> 01:24:56,787
That you could do children's stuff,

1615
01:24:56,871 --> 01:24:59,957
just a little bit,
that you could be a child,

1616
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:02,001
just a bit longer, you know?

1617
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:14,555
(gallery murmuring)

1618
01:25:16,891 --> 01:25:18,684
-(bell rings)
-BAILIFF (in French): All rise!

1619
01:25:27,401 --> 01:25:29,153
JUSTICE MINISTER:
You may be seated.

1620
01:25:31,072 --> 01:25:32,156
We'll begin

1621
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:35,660
by calling
the Chief Investigator to the bar.

1622
01:25:35,743 --> 01:25:37,286
(assistant whispering
indistinctly in French)

1623
01:25:40,456 --> 01:25:42,166
ASSISTANT:
He insists, it's important.

1624
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:46,754
(gallery murmuring)

1625
01:26:22,707 --> 01:26:23,708
(door thumps in distance)

1626
01:26:28,462 --> 01:26:30,256
You may be seated.

1627
01:26:32,425 --> 01:26:34,927
The Chief Investigator
has surely arrived,

1628
01:26:35,011 --> 01:26:37,388
so we'll start with him.

1629
01:26:38,264 --> 01:26:41,767
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Clerk, please cue Exhibit 31.

1630
01:26:43,978 --> 01:26:47,148
Bailiff, prepare to hand out

1631
01:26:47,231 --> 01:26:50,943
the transcription
of the recording to the jurors.

1632
01:26:52,403 --> 01:26:53,446
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Voilà.

1633
01:26:57,783 --> 01:26:59,076
Clerk?

1634
01:27:00,411 --> 01:27:01,662
SANDRA (on recording):
<i>What do you expect me to do?</i>

1635
01:27:01,746 --> 01:27:02,872
<i>I mean, it's part of the job,</i>

1636
01:27:02,955 --> 01:27:04,707
<i>you have to organize
yourself differently.</i>

1637
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:05,958
<i>I'm not going to cancel.</i>

1638
01:27:06,042 --> 01:27:07,001
SAMUEL: <i>How am I supposed
to get organized</i>

1639
01:27:07,084 --> 01:27:08,669
<i>differently on my own?</i>

1640
01:27:08,753 --> 01:27:10,463
<i>You know we have
to plan things together.</i>

1641
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:14,675
<i>I'm not just going
to leave Daniel alone</i>

1642
01:27:14,759 --> 01:27:16,093
<i>because you're off
doing your own thing.</i>

1643
01:27:16,177 --> 01:27:19,305
SANDRA: <i>Leave him with Monica,
what's the big deal?</i>

1644
01:27:19,388 --> 01:27:20,389
SAMUEL:
<i>Three days a week?</i>

1645
01:27:20,473 --> 01:27:22,308
<i>We'd have to pay her for that.</i>

1646
01:27:22,391 --> 01:27:23,684
<i>We can't afford it.</i>

1647
01:27:26,771 --> 01:27:28,356
SAMUEL:
<i>I need time.</i>

1648
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:30,983
Not just a few hours,

1649
01:27:31,067 --> 01:27:32,777
I'm talking about blocking out
time for myself

1650
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:34,487
for the whole year.

1651
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:36,739
This isn't working
for me anymore.

1652
01:27:36,822 --> 01:27:39,408
(Samuel drinks beer,
sets down bottle)

1653
01:27:39,492 --> 01:27:41,911
Well, organize
your time differently

1654
01:27:41,994 --> 01:27:43,412
if you want to, it's up to you.

1655
01:27:43,496 --> 01:27:44,956
SAMUEL: When's the last time
you've helped him

1656
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:46,332
-doing his homework?
-It's delicious.

1657
01:27:46,415 --> 01:27:47,959
There's a ton of things
you don't give a shit about,

1658
01:27:48,042 --> 01:27:50,795
but that's the time
I'm talking about.

1659
01:27:50,878 --> 01:27:52,713
SANDRA:
Darling, the book just came out,

1660
01:27:52,797 --> 01:27:54,841
you know very well
it's just this time--

1661
01:27:54,924 --> 01:27:57,677
It's always "just this time."

1662
01:27:59,512 --> 01:28:01,180
Whether you have a book out,

1663
01:28:01,264 --> 01:28:02,974
or you're writing,

1664
01:28:03,057 --> 01:28:05,768
or you need space to figure out
what to write...

1665
01:28:08,187 --> 01:28:10,731
I mean, I've been following
your lead for years.

1666
01:28:12,024 --> 01:28:14,443
I can't do anything with my time,

1667
01:28:14,527 --> 01:28:15,611
do you understand?

1668
01:28:19,407 --> 01:28:21,492
It's not my time, it's yours!

1669
01:28:26,497 --> 01:28:29,125
Do I force you to teach?

1670
01:28:30,835 --> 01:28:33,337
Do I force you
to homeschool Daniel?

1671
01:28:34,672 --> 01:28:36,507
No one's forcing you.

1672
01:28:36,591 --> 01:28:38,217
If you want to make
more time for yourself,

1673
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:39,719
-I've never stopped you.
-Are you fucking serious?

1674
01:28:39,802 --> 01:28:41,012
(plate clatters)

1675
01:28:41,095 --> 01:28:43,306
I cut my course load
in half this year

1676
01:28:43,389 --> 01:28:46,017
to gain more time,
and it's still not enough.

1677
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,810
I have to finish the renovation,

1678
01:28:47,894 --> 01:28:49,854
plus I'm dealing
with everything else.

1679
01:28:51,147 --> 01:28:54,025
Why do you refuse to talk about it?

1680
01:28:54,108 --> 01:28:56,110
Why can't you just admit
that it has to do

1681
01:28:56,194 --> 01:28:57,737
with how things
are divided between us?

1682
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:59,071
SANDRA:
Because you are wrong,

1683
01:28:59,155 --> 01:29:01,991
I don't owe you any time,
I do my part.

1684
01:29:02,074 --> 01:29:06,120
C'mon, let's not start taking
inventory here, please.

1685
01:29:06,204 --> 01:29:07,622
Let's relax.

1686
01:29:14,462 --> 01:29:15,755
SANDRA (softly):
I love you.

1687
01:29:22,678 --> 01:29:25,473
SANDRA: When you decided
to homeschool Daniel,

1688
01:29:25,556 --> 01:29:27,767
I told you, "Be careful,"

1689
01:29:27,850 --> 01:29:29,685
it's a beautiful and generous choice,

1690
01:29:29,769 --> 01:29:32,021
and I thank you for it,
but you don't have to do it,

1691
01:29:32,104 --> 01:29:33,648
and I told you
it would force you to...

1692
01:29:33,731 --> 01:29:34,774
-SAMUEL: What?
-...cut your...

1693
01:29:34,857 --> 01:29:36,734
Force me to spend more time
with my son?

1694
01:29:38,194 --> 01:29:39,529
Well, I'm glad I did.

1695
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:42,073
I wouldn't have the relationship

1696
01:29:42,156 --> 01:29:43,741
I have with him today if I didn't.

1697
01:29:47,203 --> 01:29:49,539
Yeah, the relationship
that I don't have with him

1698
01:29:49,622 --> 01:29:51,290
-is what you meant to say.
-No, I didn't say that.

1699
01:29:51,374 --> 01:29:52,750
-No.
-No.

1700
01:29:56,879 --> 01:30:00,800
SAMUEL:
I'm saying maybe, just maybe,

1701
01:30:00,883 --> 01:30:03,177
things are little
out of balance between us,

1702
01:30:03,261 --> 01:30:04,679
and I want you
to take a look at that.

1703
01:30:04,762 --> 01:30:06,138
Why is this so hard to discuss?

1704
01:30:06,222 --> 01:30:07,431
First of all, I don't believe

1705
01:30:07,515 --> 01:30:09,058
in the notion
of reciprocity in a couple.

1706
01:30:09,141 --> 01:30:11,185
It's naive and, frankly,
it's depressing.

1707
01:30:11,269 --> 01:30:12,478
Yes.

1708
01:30:12,562 --> 01:30:15,523
And I think discussing it
is a waste of time,

1709
01:30:15,606 --> 01:30:18,317
considering the state
you're in, seriously.

1710
01:30:18,401 --> 01:30:22,488
All this blah, blah, blah here
and more time is gone,

1711
01:30:22,572 --> 01:30:25,324
all this time spent chitchatting
could be spent in silence,

1712
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:26,909
doing whatever you want to do,

1713
01:30:26,993 --> 01:30:28,244
if only you knew what it is that...

1714
01:30:28,327 --> 01:30:29,787
SAMUEL:
I want time to start writing,

1715
01:30:29,871 --> 01:30:31,539
just the same as you.

1716
01:30:31,622 --> 01:30:32,874
SANDRA: Do it.

1717
01:30:32,957 --> 01:30:34,375
I don't know a single writer
who doesn't write

1718
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:36,460
just because he has a son
and a house and groceries to buy.

1719
01:30:36,544 --> 01:30:38,921
Stop whining
about your scheduling bullshit

1720
01:30:39,005 --> 01:30:40,840
and drop this logic which
comes down to casting blame

1721
01:30:40,923 --> 01:30:42,800
on me for what you did or didn't do.

1722
01:30:42,884 --> 01:30:45,636
I live with you,
I plan my life around you.

1723
01:30:47,388 --> 01:30:50,808
If I imposed on you
what you're imposing on me,

1724
01:30:50,892 --> 01:30:52,602
neither of us
would be able to write.

1725
01:30:52,685 --> 01:30:55,646
SANDRA: Don't worry about me,
I always manage to write.

1726
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:58,566
-Great. Perfect.
-SANDRA: Yeah.

1727
01:30:58,649 --> 01:31:00,776
If you're so sure of yourself,
adapt-- that's all I'm asking.

1728
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:03,237
I do adapt.
I take Daniel to school.

1729
01:31:03,321 --> 01:31:04,405
SAMUEL:
Once a week.

1730
01:31:04,488 --> 01:31:05,823
We have Monica
on Tuesdays, c'mon.

1731
01:31:05,907 --> 01:31:07,366
SAMUEL:
No, Sandra, don't be dishonest.

1732
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:09,160
(scoffs) I'm not,
you're the one nitpicking.

1733
01:31:09,243 --> 01:31:10,286
SAMUEL:
I've given you too much--

1734
01:31:10,369 --> 01:31:12,747
too much time,
too many concessions.

1735
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:16,626
I want this time back
and you owe it to me, be fair!

1736
01:31:16,709 --> 01:31:18,920
(laughs) I'm sorry,
but no, are you insane?

1737
01:31:19,003 --> 01:31:22,048
I don't owe you anything, really.

1738
01:31:22,131 --> 01:31:24,217
This is about
your relationship with your son

1739
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:25,551
and to protect yourself
and your comfort

1740
01:31:25,635 --> 01:31:26,928
and because you got scared
and you put yourself

1741
01:31:27,011 --> 01:31:28,638
in that position.

1742
01:31:28,721 --> 01:31:32,266
It was your choice to come here
and start this renovation.

1743
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:34,352
This is your own trap.

1744
01:31:34,435 --> 01:31:36,562
-Okay, now you're talking about the past.
-It's your own trap-- No!

1745
01:31:36,646 --> 01:31:38,231
-I could answer point by point.
-I'm not taking time from you!

1746
01:31:38,314 --> 01:31:39,398
-But fuck that!
-You wasted it all on your own!

1747
01:31:39,482 --> 01:31:41,150
I want things to change now.

1748
01:31:41,234 --> 01:31:43,569
I want time to start writing again.

1749
01:31:43,653 --> 01:31:45,780
SANDRA:
Great, go for it.

1750
01:31:45,863 --> 01:31:48,074
If you want my advice,
go back to the one you ditched.

1751
01:31:49,242 --> 01:31:51,160
That's your advice?

1752
01:31:51,244 --> 01:31:53,371
Go back to a book
that you plundered?

1753
01:31:53,454 --> 01:31:54,872
Okay, now it's plundering?

1754
01:31:54,956 --> 01:31:56,999
Okay. We've discussed it--
you'd given up.

1755
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:58,960
(Samuel laughs sardonically)

1756
01:31:59,043 --> 01:32:00,628
You took the book's best idea,

1757
01:32:00,711 --> 01:32:03,214
how am I supposed
to just "go back to it"?

1758
01:32:03,297 --> 01:32:04,924
Do you realize
how cynical that is of you?

1759
01:32:05,007 --> 01:32:06,676
You can publish your own version

1760
01:32:06,759 --> 01:32:08,094
and say it inspired me,

1761
01:32:08,177 --> 01:32:09,846
-I'll admit to it.
-(Samuel scoffs)

1762
01:32:09,929 --> 01:32:11,180
If something needs to be written,

1763
01:32:11,264 --> 01:32:13,516
-someone has to write it.
-SAMUEL: Oh, wow.

1764
01:32:13,599 --> 01:32:15,101
You know what,
you have animal vision.

1765
01:32:15,184 --> 01:32:16,769
You pretend to be obliging, but...

1766
01:32:16,853 --> 01:32:18,688
Look at you,
even your bullshit moral,

1767
01:32:18,771 --> 01:32:20,231
it's bullshit moralizing what you do.

1768
01:32:20,314 --> 01:32:21,607
-(Samuel scoffs)
-Yeah. And this,

1769
01:32:21,691 --> 01:32:24,026
really, it's a way
for you to waste more time.

1770
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:25,736
-Each one in his territory.
-You should be flattered

1771
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:27,196
that I was inspired by you.

1772
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:28,739
This is life,
things circulate, you know.

1773
01:32:28,823 --> 01:32:31,075
-SAMUEL (sarcastically): Yes.
-Yes?

1774
01:32:31,158 --> 01:32:33,619
And frankly,
I wish you'd be inspired

1775
01:32:33,703 --> 01:32:34,996
-to "plunder" me someday.
-You are not alone

1776
01:32:35,079 --> 01:32:36,330
in your jungle, I live with you

1777
01:32:36,414 --> 01:32:37,540
and you impose everything.

1778
01:32:37,623 --> 01:32:39,792
You impose your rhythm,
your use of time,

1779
01:32:39,876 --> 01:32:41,919
you even impose your language.

1780
01:32:42,003 --> 01:32:43,337
When even it comes to language,

1781
01:32:43,421 --> 01:32:44,797
I'm the one meeting you
on your turf:

1782
01:32:44,881 --> 01:32:46,924
We...
We speak English at home.

1783
01:32:47,008 --> 01:32:48,009
SANDRA:
I'm not on my turf.

1784
01:32:48,092 --> 01:32:49,427
I don't speak my mother tongue.

1785
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,928
SAMUEL:
You don't speak mine either.

1786
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:53,347
-Even though we live here.
-Yes, it's a middle ground,

1787
01:32:53,431 --> 01:32:54,932
-in fact, you know.
-Yes.

1788
01:32:55,016 --> 01:32:57,435
Because I'm not French,
you're not German,

1789
01:32:57,518 --> 01:32:59,061
so we create a middle ground.

1790
01:32:59,145 --> 01:33:01,063
So nobody has to meet
the other on their turf.

1791
01:33:01,147 --> 01:33:02,523
This is what English is for,

1792
01:33:02,607 --> 01:33:04,859
it's our meeting point,
you can't blame me for that.

1793
01:33:04,942 --> 01:33:06,569
SAMUEL:
But we live in France.

1794
01:33:06,652 --> 01:33:08,196
-That is our reality.
-Yeah.

1795
01:33:08,279 --> 01:33:09,405
Daniel hears you
speak in a language

1796
01:33:09,488 --> 01:33:11,157
that has nothing to do with his life.

1797
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:12,867
Just because
you imposed this on him,

1798
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:14,493
just like everything else.

1799
01:33:14,577 --> 01:33:16,746
We're on your turf, all the time...

1800
01:33:16,829 --> 01:33:18,915
Yeah, in your country.

1801
01:33:18,998 --> 01:33:21,709
Every single day,
I have to accept

1802
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,003
that we live in your hometown.

1803
01:33:24,086 --> 01:33:26,380
The people that you grew up with,
they look down on me

1804
01:33:26,464 --> 01:33:29,175
whenever I don't make
the effort to smile at them.

1805
01:33:30,593 --> 01:33:32,845
You don't think me living here

1806
01:33:32,929 --> 01:33:34,972
counts as meeting you on your turf?

1807
01:33:35,056 --> 01:33:37,892
-You never smile at anyone.
-Yeah!

1808
01:33:37,975 --> 01:33:39,977
That's why you love me, right?

1809
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:41,896
Because if you wanted
to have some stupid bitch

1810
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:43,606
who grins at your friends
at the ski slopes,

1811
01:33:43,689 --> 01:33:45,066
you'd have picked someone else.

1812
01:33:45,149 --> 01:33:46,943
(Samuel laughs sardonically)

1813
01:33:50,488 --> 01:33:51,989
SAMUEL:
You really have no shame.

1814
01:33:52,073 --> 01:33:53,658
That's your superpower,

1815
01:33:53,741 --> 01:33:55,576
it allows you to see no one
but yourself.

1816
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:56,661
I see you very clearly.

1817
01:33:56,744 --> 01:33:58,162
I just don't see you as a victim.

1818
01:33:59,705 --> 01:34:02,333
You impose your way of living,

1819
01:34:02,416 --> 01:34:05,294
speaking, eating, even fucking.

1820
01:34:05,378 --> 01:34:07,630
I could never get you
to fuck any other way.

1821
01:34:07,713 --> 01:34:09,507
Because...you just expect me
to follow your lead.

1822
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:11,133
That's your notion
of what a couple is.

1823
01:34:11,217 --> 01:34:12,510
I don't believe that. I don't...

1824
01:34:12,593 --> 01:34:14,637
(scoffs)
I don't have a notion.

1825
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:17,390
I don't give a fuck
about couples, really.

1826
01:34:19,892 --> 01:34:23,020
So, you say I'm stopping you

1827
01:34:23,104 --> 01:34:25,106
from fucking the way you want?

1828
01:34:25,189 --> 01:34:26,899
-Seriously?
-Yes.

1829
01:34:26,983 --> 01:34:30,027
Be honest: Who's been refusing
to fuck since the accident?

1830
01:34:30,111 --> 01:34:31,487
You know damn well I meant before.

1831
01:34:31,571 --> 01:34:34,657
What did I ever refuse
to do sexually?

1832
01:34:37,451 --> 01:34:38,494
Everything.

1833
01:34:40,288 --> 01:34:41,664
Everything, plus I have

1834
01:34:41,747 --> 01:34:43,374
to accept that you fuck other people.

1835
01:34:43,457 --> 01:34:44,542
I do not fuck other people!

1836
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:46,252
(scoffs) Don't deny it.

1837
01:34:46,335 --> 01:34:48,129
Once! And you cling to it

1838
01:34:48,212 --> 01:34:50,047
-in order to suffer.
-You have fucked other people!

1839
01:34:50,131 --> 01:34:51,257
-You do this all the time.
-Several times!

1840
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:52,425
You make yourself the victim!

1841
01:34:52,508 --> 01:34:54,177
SAMUEL:
I'm not a victim!

1842
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:55,845
I am a man
who's been cheated on!

1843
01:34:55,928 --> 01:34:58,347
-Plundered, and cheated on!
-(deeply exhales)

1844
01:35:02,518 --> 01:35:04,228
SANDRA:
I can live without sex,

1845
01:35:04,312 --> 01:35:05,521
but not forever.

1846
01:35:06,647 --> 01:35:08,024
SAMUEL:
So what, you're blaming me?

1847
01:35:08,107 --> 01:35:09,317
I'm the one frustrating you?

1848
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,986
It's not about who's,
who's, who's, who's...

1849
01:35:12,069 --> 01:35:14,780
who's blaming who
or who's frustrating who.

1850
01:35:14,864 --> 01:35:16,199
The frustration is there

1851
01:35:16,282 --> 01:35:18,326
and we're both dealing
with it, you see.

1852
01:35:18,409 --> 01:35:21,871
Me, personally,
I refuse to rot inside,

1853
01:35:21,954 --> 01:35:23,664
so I find solutions, and at this point,

1854
01:35:23,748 --> 01:35:25,917
sex was just a question
of personal hygiene.

1855
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,503
Yes, but you impose your solutions,

1856
01:35:28,586 --> 01:35:30,463
which are solutions for you only.

1857
01:35:30,546 --> 01:35:32,507
You don't give a shit
if it hurts me and Daniel.

1858
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:34,383
You leave Daniel
out of the game here.

1859
01:35:34,467 --> 01:35:35,885
This is not about Daniel.

1860
01:35:35,968 --> 01:35:37,595
I do not impose
anything on Daniel.

1861
01:35:37,678 --> 01:35:39,722
You made us live here
among the goats!

1862
01:35:39,805 --> 01:35:42,016
You complain about the life
that you chose!

1863
01:35:42,099 --> 01:35:43,893
You're not a victim!

1864
01:35:43,976 --> 01:35:45,811
Not at all!

1865
01:35:45,895 --> 01:35:49,524
Your generosity conceals
something dirtier and meaner.

1866
01:35:50,983 --> 01:35:52,568
You're incapable
of facing your ambitions,

1867
01:35:52,652 --> 01:35:54,028
and you resent me for it.

1868
01:35:54,111 --> 01:35:55,738
But I'm not the one
who put you where you are.

1869
01:35:55,821 --> 01:35:58,324
I have nothing to do with it!

1870
01:35:58,407 --> 01:36:01,035
You're not sacrificing yourself,
as you say.

1871
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:04,664
You choose to sit
on the sidelines because you're afraid!

1872
01:36:04,747 --> 01:36:06,707
Because your pride
makes your head explode

1873
01:36:06,791 --> 01:36:09,794
before you can even come up
with a little germ of an idea!

1874
01:36:09,877 --> 01:36:11,671
And now you wake up
and you're forty,

1875
01:36:11,754 --> 01:36:12,713
and you need someone to blame.

1876
01:36:12,797 --> 01:36:14,465
And you're the one to blame!

1877
01:36:16,551 --> 01:36:19,303
You're petrified
by your own fucking standards

1878
01:36:19,387 --> 01:36:20,847
and your fear of failure.

1879
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:22,431
This is the truth!

1880
01:36:22,515 --> 01:36:23,975
You're smart,
and I know you know I'm right.

1881
01:36:24,058 --> 01:36:24,892
And Daniel...

1882
01:36:24,976 --> 01:36:26,811
<i>has nothing to do with it.</i>

1883
01:36:26,894 --> 01:36:28,229
<i>Stop it!</i>

1884
01:36:32,692 --> 01:36:34,235
SAMUEL:
<i>You're a monster.</i>

1885
01:36:35,570 --> 01:36:37,780
<i>Even Daniel says it,
with his own words.</i>

1886
01:36:37,864 --> 01:36:39,365
SANDRA: <i>You take that back,
you piece of shit.</i>

1887
01:36:39,448 --> 01:36:41,701
<i>-You take that back.
-He's told me countless times</i>

1888
01:36:41,784 --> 01:36:43,327
<i>how hard you are,
do you know that?</i>

1889
01:36:43,411 --> 01:36:45,121
SANDRA: <i>He's telling you
what you want to hear!</i>

1890
01:36:45,204 --> 01:36:46,455
<i>He can feel your guilt,</i>

1891
01:36:46,539 --> 01:36:48,541
<i>and he's trying to reassure you.</i>

1892
01:36:48,624 --> 01:36:50,042
<i>Don't you see that?</i>

1893
01:36:50,126 --> 01:36:52,795
<i>You've never stopped
feeling guilty about him!</i>

1894
01:36:52,879 --> 01:36:55,214
SAMUEL: <i>You're cold-hearted.
You have no pity.</i>

1895
01:36:55,298 --> 01:36:57,091
SANDRA: <i>Yes, and you have
way too much for yourself.</i>

1896
01:36:57,175 --> 01:36:59,886
SAMUEL: <i>I can't stand
any more of your fucking ice!</i>

1897
01:36:59,969 --> 01:37:02,054
<i>(dishes shattering)</i>

1898
01:37:02,138 --> 01:37:03,347
SAMUEL:
<i>You're violent!</i>

1899
01:37:03,431 --> 01:37:04,515
SANDRA:
<i>Yes, I am violent!</i>

1900
01:37:04,599 --> 01:37:05,850
<i>(blow lands; slap)</i>

1901
01:37:05,933 --> 01:37:07,602
<i>(objects and bodies clattering)</i>

1902
01:37:07,685 --> 01:37:09,395
<i>(slapping on clothing;
Sandra whimpering)</i>

1903
01:37:09,478 --> 01:37:10,605
<i>(dishes clattering; Sandra shrieks)</i>

1904
01:37:10,688 --> 01:37:12,356
<i>(objects crash)</i>

1905
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,317
<i>(Sandra grunts, pants, shrieks)</i>

1906
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,526
<i>(Samuel grunting loudly)</i>

1907
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:17,778
<i>(slapping on body)</i>

1908
01:37:17,862 --> 01:37:19,238
<i>(Samuel groaning in pain)</i>

1909
01:37:19,322 --> 01:37:21,574
<i>(Sandra exhales loudly, shrieks)</i>

1910
01:37:21,657 --> 01:37:23,826
<i>(two deep blows land;
Samuel groans loudly)</i>

1911
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:25,578
<i>(both panting)</i>

1912
01:37:33,211 --> 01:37:34,170
(in French)
So...

1913
01:37:35,004 --> 01:37:38,758
Can you tell us
where you found this recording?

1914
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:43,262
On a USB key belonging to the victim.

1915
01:37:43,346 --> 01:37:47,600
He made several dozen recordings
on his cell phone.

1916
01:37:48,351 --> 01:37:52,313
For six months, he'd been recording
moments from his life.

1917
01:37:52,396 --> 01:37:54,148
For a literary project, apparently.

1918
01:37:54,482 --> 01:37:56,734
CHIEF INVESTIGATOR:
Did he transcribe all the recordings?

1919
01:37:56,817 --> 01:37:58,861
Yes, except this last argument.

1920
01:37:59,654 --> 01:38:03,324
Does your investigation link
this argument to his death?

1921
01:38:03,407 --> 01:38:07,119
CHIEF INVESTIGATOR: Yes. They occurred
20 hours apart and have common themes.

1922
01:38:07,203 --> 01:38:09,163
He criticizes her infidelity.

1923
01:38:09,247 --> 01:38:11,666
A pretty girl comes the next day.

1924
01:38:11,999 --> 01:38:14,502
A literature student,

1925
01:38:14,585 --> 01:38:17,547
to interview Sandra Voyter
about her books.

1926
01:38:18,339 --> 01:38:20,925
There must've been tension in the air.

1927
01:38:21,008 --> 01:38:22,343
The two women

1928
01:38:22,426 --> 01:38:26,514
were enjoying themselves
while he worked hard upstairs.

1929
01:38:27,890 --> 01:38:31,811
The argument can be seen
as a dress rehearsal for the next day.

1930
01:38:31,894 --> 01:38:36,274
How do you interpret
the violent outbursts?

1931
01:38:36,732 --> 01:38:38,234
CHIEF INVESTIGATOR:
We hear blows.

1932
01:38:39,068 --> 01:38:42,405
A physical altercation,
the accused striking her husband.

1933
01:38:42,488 --> 01:38:46,117
What makes it possible for you
to reach that conclusion?

1934
01:38:46,993 --> 01:38:49,745
She seems to be
in a more intense state of rage.

1935
01:38:49,829 --> 01:38:51,747
(Justice Minister speaks French)

1936
01:38:52,707 --> 01:38:53,624
Sorry?

1937
01:38:53,708 --> 01:38:55,710
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Speak directly to the court.

1938
01:38:55,793 --> 01:38:59,172
She's clearly
in a more intense state of rage.

1939
01:39:00,673 --> 01:39:05,344
Her shouts at the end of the recording
are the last step

1940
01:39:05,428 --> 01:39:07,847
before the violence gets physical.

1941
01:39:08,264 --> 01:39:11,767
The confusion that follows
is hard to analyze, but...

1942
01:39:12,185 --> 01:39:15,396
we hear blows to a body or a face,

1943
01:39:15,479 --> 01:39:18,232
and the muffled screams we hear

1944
01:39:18,316 --> 01:39:20,067
are Mr. Maleski's.

1945
01:39:20,151 --> 01:39:22,445
You mentioned bruises on Ms. Voyter.

1946
01:39:22,528 --> 01:39:24,906
Show Exhibit 9, please.

1947
01:39:25,489 --> 01:39:28,826
ADVOCATE GENERAL: This photo was taken
on the day her husband died.

1948
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:30,661
How did she explain it?

1949
01:39:30,745 --> 01:39:34,457
She initially told us she'd bumped
into a kitchen counter.

1950
01:39:35,082 --> 01:39:38,294
We pointed out that the bruising
was around her wrist,

1951
01:39:38,377 --> 01:39:41,422
and looked a lot
like signs of a struggle.

1952
01:39:42,131 --> 01:39:44,842
Later, when we played her
the recording,

1953
01:39:44,926 --> 01:39:48,262
she admitted it had happened then,

1954
01:39:48,346 --> 01:39:49,764
during their brief struggle.

1955
01:39:49,847 --> 01:39:51,766
So you admit you lied?

1956
01:39:52,642 --> 01:39:53,851
SANDRA (in English):
Uh, yes.

1957
01:39:53,935 --> 01:39:57,355
Uh, because, uh, I was afraid

1958
01:39:57,438 --> 01:39:59,106
that if I, if I mentioned it,

1959
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:01,567
um, yeah, I knew

1960
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:03,611
it would make me a suspect,
and I got scared.

1961
01:40:03,694 --> 01:40:05,279
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
And you didn't know

1962
01:40:05,363 --> 01:40:06,989
he'd recorded the fight.

1963
01:40:07,073 --> 01:40:08,491
So you lied twice.

1964
01:40:08,574 --> 01:40:12,078
About the bruises,
and by not mentioning the fight.

1965
01:40:12,161 --> 01:40:13,746
(in English, stammering)
For me, it was...

1966
01:40:13,829 --> 01:40:15,122
It was just one lie.

1967
01:40:15,206 --> 01:40:16,707
Because, if I had been honest

1968
01:40:16,791 --> 01:40:18,876
about the bruises, I'd have
mentioned the argument.

1969
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,586
And I didn't, um...

1970
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:22,255
I didn't want to be seen as guilty.

1971
01:40:22,338 --> 01:40:24,298
(in French)
As no guilty person ever does.

1972
01:40:24,382 --> 01:40:26,884
Can we time the bruises exactly?

1973
01:40:26,968 --> 01:40:29,262
CHIEF INVESTIGATOR: The doctor
examined her the following day.

1974
01:40:30,096 --> 01:40:34,475
It was too late to determine exactly
when they occurred.

1975
01:40:34,559 --> 01:40:36,185
So it's possible

1976
01:40:36,269 --> 01:40:40,189
a second fight caused the bruises
on the day Mr. Maleski died.

1977
01:40:49,574 --> 01:40:51,868
VINCENT: What do we hear
at the end of the argument?

1978
01:40:53,077 --> 01:40:56,038
(in English) The first sound
of breaking glass is me

1979
01:40:56,122 --> 01:40:58,207
throwing a glass against the wall--

1980
01:40:58,291 --> 01:40:59,250
it's a wine glass

1981
01:40:59,333 --> 01:41:01,669
that stood on the table.

1982
01:41:01,752 --> 01:41:03,713
And after that, I, ahem,

1983
01:41:03,796 --> 01:41:06,716
I went over to my husband
and I slapped him.

1984
01:41:06,799 --> 01:41:10,094
And that's when he grabbed
my wrist quite violently

1985
01:41:10,178 --> 01:41:12,763
and that's the struggling we can hear.

1986
01:41:12,847 --> 01:41:15,474
And just after, I tried to stop him

1987
01:41:15,558 --> 01:41:17,351
from throwing
picture frames to the floor.

1988
01:41:17,435 --> 01:41:20,104
But I couldn't, so we,
we hear them shattering.

1989
01:41:20,188 --> 01:41:22,481
(in French) Aside from that slap,
did you hit him?

1990
01:41:22,565 --> 01:41:23,608
No.

1991
01:41:25,276 --> 01:41:26,819
(in English)
What we hear next

1992
01:41:26,903 --> 01:41:29,405
is Samuel repeatedly hitting himself

1993
01:41:29,488 --> 01:41:31,574
in the face and in the head,

1994
01:41:31,657 --> 01:41:34,410
and then, uh, punching the wall.

1995
01:41:34,493 --> 01:41:35,912
You can still see the dent.

1996
01:41:35,995 --> 01:41:38,706
Um, there are a few of them
around the house.

1997
01:41:38,789 --> 01:41:40,416
It's not the first time
he'd done that.

1998
01:41:40,499 --> 01:41:42,293
Uh, years ago,

1999
01:41:42,376 --> 01:41:44,879
he already broke, um, a finger,

2000
01:41:44,962 --> 01:41:47,673
uh, punching the wall
during an episode.

2001
01:41:49,926 --> 01:41:52,678
(in French) We have photos
of those dents in the wall.

2002
01:41:52,762 --> 01:41:54,430
Thank you. Here.

2003
01:41:54,514 --> 01:41:56,974
And the X-ray
of his fractured finger,

2004
01:41:57,058 --> 01:42:00,686
taken in June 2017
at the hospital in Grenoble.

2005
01:42:01,896 --> 01:42:03,272
Is it fair to say

2006
01:42:03,356 --> 01:42:08,361
your depiction of the violence
is interpretive and not objective?

2007
01:42:09,987 --> 01:42:12,782
She repeatedly lied to us,
so believing her...

2008
01:42:12,865 --> 01:42:14,784
Thus, this is about believing,

2009
01:42:14,867 --> 01:42:16,244
or not believing.

2010
01:42:16,577 --> 01:42:18,538
It's a subjective opinion,

2011
01:42:18,621 --> 01:42:20,873
based on an ambiguous recording.

2012
01:42:21,832 --> 01:42:24,794
You link the argument
to the day of the death.

2013
01:42:24,877 --> 01:42:27,672
You call it a "dress rehearsal."

2014
01:42:27,755 --> 01:42:29,632
Do you have any direct proof?

2015
01:42:29,715 --> 01:42:32,844
The recording
is direct proof of a fight.

2016
01:42:32,927 --> 01:42:34,679
VINCENT:
I mean the day of the death.

2017
01:42:35,888 --> 01:42:39,308
With no witnesses or confessions,
we must interpret.

2018
01:42:41,769 --> 01:42:44,981
In fact, this violent fight is...

2019
01:42:45,064 --> 01:42:48,150
phantasmal--
it exists only as fantasy.

2020
01:42:48,776 --> 01:42:50,319
You float the idea,

2021
01:42:50,403 --> 01:42:52,154
the prosecutor floats it,

2022
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:55,116
over or around the facts,

2023
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:58,536
making it omnipresent
here in court, but...

2024
01:43:00,371 --> 01:43:03,624
We risk turning this fantasy
into a reality

2025
01:43:03,708 --> 01:43:07,253
simply because
there was indeed a fight

2026
01:43:07,336 --> 01:43:10,131
the day before Mr. Maleski died.

2027
01:43:10,673 --> 01:43:14,552
Don't substitute the day
before for the next day.

2028
01:43:15,761 --> 01:43:19,515
We can't fill the blanks
with a supposition,

2029
01:43:19,599 --> 01:43:23,436
simply because we have sounds
for one and not the other.

2030
01:43:23,519 --> 01:43:24,520
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Ms. Voyter,

2031
01:43:24,604 --> 01:43:28,566
did you know he'd recorded you
before you were told?

2032
01:43:29,901 --> 01:43:31,277
SANDRA (in English):
No. But I knew that

2033
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,821
he often recorded moments
of our lives.

2034
01:43:33,905 --> 01:43:36,282
JUSTICE MINISTER (in French):
He didn't always let you know?

2035
01:43:36,365 --> 01:43:38,409
What were these recordings?

2036
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,245
(in English) Um, at first,
he would mention it,

2037
01:43:41,329 --> 01:43:44,415
yes, but after a while he did it
without us really knowing.

2038
01:43:44,498 --> 01:43:49,587
He recorded conversations,
Daniel's piano lessons...

2039
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:53,174
and sometimes just himself,
talking to himself.

2040
01:43:53,257 --> 01:43:55,801
And I think he did that because
he wanted to gather material

2041
01:43:55,885 --> 01:43:57,595
to help him start writing again.

2042
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:02,600
Now, with hindsight,
it seems possible

2043
01:44:02,683 --> 01:44:04,519
that he could have
provoked this fight

2044
01:44:04,602 --> 01:44:06,187
just to record it.

2045
01:44:06,270 --> 01:44:08,523
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
Wait, are you implying

2046
01:44:08,606 --> 01:44:10,608
you're the victim of a twisted man?

2047
01:44:10,691 --> 01:44:11,817
NOUR: Seriously?

2048
01:44:12,401 --> 01:44:15,905
He recorded her in secret.
It's a valid question.

2049
01:44:15,988 --> 01:44:18,574
You forget the situation is perverse.

2050
01:44:19,408 --> 01:44:20,785
Now the victim is on trial!

2051
01:44:20,868 --> 01:44:22,870
NOUR:
No, but my client has a point.

2052
01:44:22,954 --> 01:44:26,332
Can you explain
what he means by cheating,

2053
01:44:26,415 --> 01:44:27,917
and how he found out?

2054
01:44:28,835 --> 01:44:30,002
(Sandra sighs)

2055
01:44:30,086 --> 01:44:31,379
(in English)
He went through my phone

2056
01:44:31,462 --> 01:44:33,589
and he discovered messages
from a woman

2057
01:44:33,673 --> 01:44:35,550
I'd met at the beginning
of that year.

2058
01:44:35,633 --> 01:44:38,344
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
What do you mean by "met"?

2059
01:44:38,427 --> 01:44:39,637
(in English)
It was sexual.

2060
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:41,013
We slept together twice.

2061
01:44:41,097 --> 01:44:42,223
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
Twice?

2062
01:44:42,306 --> 01:44:43,391
(in French)
Yes.

2063
01:44:43,474 --> 01:44:46,102
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
On the recording you said once.

2064
01:44:47,103 --> 01:44:49,146
(in English)
It meant with just one person.

2065
01:44:50,064 --> 01:44:51,774
(in French)
Hang on...

2066
01:44:51,858 --> 01:44:55,444
Samuel mentions
numerous affairs in the past.

2067
01:44:55,528 --> 01:44:58,322
It sounds like
you cheated constantly.

2068
01:44:58,406 --> 01:44:59,949
(in English)
That's not-- That's not true.

2069
01:45:00,032 --> 01:45:02,368
Uh, I had a few flings, um,

2070
01:45:02,451 --> 01:45:04,245
the year of Daniel's accident.

2071
01:45:04,328 --> 01:45:06,205
And it wasn't cheating,
because Samuel knew.

2072
01:45:06,289 --> 01:45:08,249
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
He found out each time?

2073
01:45:08,332 --> 01:45:09,792
(in English)
No, I told him.

2074
01:45:10,793 --> 01:45:12,211
It was a tricky year. Heh.

2075
01:45:12,295 --> 01:45:14,797
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
You want us to believe he agreed to it?

2076
01:45:14,881 --> 01:45:16,716
(in English)
Uh, I'm not saying that,

2077
01:45:16,799 --> 01:45:20,052
I'm just saying I was honest about it.

2078
01:45:20,136 --> 01:45:21,929
(in French)
Interesting take on honesty.

2079
01:45:22,013 --> 01:45:25,474
But the year he died,
you quit being honest, why?

2080
01:45:27,143 --> 01:45:28,311
(sighs)

2081
01:45:28,394 --> 01:45:30,104
(in English)
Things were different...

2082
01:45:30,188 --> 01:45:33,608
I felt that it would hurt him
too much, at that time, so...

2083
01:45:33,691 --> 01:45:36,611
(in French) Because you had feelings
for that woman?

2084
01:45:36,694 --> 01:45:38,362
(in English) No, I felt
it would hurt him too much

2085
01:45:38,446 --> 01:45:39,780
because he was fragile.

2086
01:45:39,864 --> 01:45:42,867
And, uh, as I said,

2087
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:44,660
with her, it was just sexual.

2088
01:45:44,744 --> 01:45:47,288
And the person I had
feelings for was Samuel.

2089
01:45:47,371 --> 01:45:49,540
(in French)
Interesting take on feelings.

2090
01:45:49,624 --> 01:45:51,042
I'm trying to understand.

2091
01:45:51,125 --> 01:45:54,420
At first you agreed
on an open relationship,

2092
01:45:54,504 --> 01:45:56,214
then that changed?

2093
01:45:57,006 --> 01:45:58,925
(in English) Uh, I don't even know
what that means, really I'm sorry.

2094
01:45:59,008 --> 01:46:00,635
-(A.G. speaks French)
-No, pardon.

2095
01:46:00,718 --> 01:46:02,595
(in English) No, we never had
that kind of agreement,

2096
01:46:02,678 --> 01:46:04,263
or something like that.

2097
01:46:04,347 --> 01:46:06,182
After the accident, we were both

2098
01:46:06,265 --> 01:46:08,518
trying to feel better,

2099
01:46:08,601 --> 01:46:10,478
and I needed that
to keep it together,

2100
01:46:10,561 --> 01:46:11,812
and I was honest about it.

2101
01:46:11,896 --> 01:46:15,733
(in French) But then you quit being honest
and he held you accountable.

2102
01:46:15,816 --> 01:46:18,319
He doesn't sound "fragile."

2103
01:46:18,402 --> 01:46:20,863
-Do you admit he was jealous?
-Yes.

2104
01:46:20,947 --> 01:46:23,032
Had he become obsessed?

2105
01:46:23,115 --> 01:46:24,992
(in English)
No, I don't-- I don't know.

2106
01:46:25,076 --> 01:46:27,203
He was hurt, that's true.

2107
01:46:27,286 --> 01:46:29,956
And, uh,
sometimes when we fought,

2108
01:46:30,039 --> 01:46:32,875
he brought it up, but he didn't
think about all the time.

2109
01:46:34,168 --> 01:46:35,336
According to your logic,

2110
01:46:35,419 --> 01:46:36,921
all of Samuel's problems

2111
01:46:37,004 --> 01:46:39,298
were my fault, that's not true.

2112
01:46:39,382 --> 01:46:41,342
I mean, his pain came
from deeper places.

2113
01:46:41,425 --> 01:46:45,680
(in French) According to his logic,
you're to blame, as we heard.

2114
01:46:45,763 --> 01:46:49,308
What does he mean when he says
his work was plundered?

2115
01:46:49,392 --> 01:46:50,643
(in English)
No. There never was any--

2116
01:46:50,726 --> 01:46:52,645
There wasn't any plundering.

2117
01:46:52,728 --> 01:46:54,856
In the that book he abandoned,
and that's important,

2118
01:46:54,939 --> 01:46:56,399
there was
a very interesting passage--

2119
01:46:56,482 --> 01:46:58,776
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
A passage? How many pages?

2120
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:00,319
(in English)
About twenty.

2121
01:47:00,403 --> 01:47:01,362
(in French)
Twenty-seven.

2122
01:47:01,445 --> 01:47:02,738
(in English)
Oui. Yeah, it was just

2123
01:47:02,822 --> 01:47:04,198
a rough outline, and I thought

2124
01:47:04,282 --> 01:47:05,575
the idea was brilliant.

2125
01:47:05,658 --> 01:47:06,868
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
Can you summarize it?

2126
01:47:06,951 --> 01:47:09,787
NOUR: Must we enter
into a literary debate?

2127
01:47:09,871 --> 01:47:11,873
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
This isn't literary, it's concrete.

2128
01:47:12,123 --> 01:47:13,833
It's the heart of their conflict.

2129
01:47:14,166 --> 01:47:17,503
I don't know how else
to present it to the jurors.

2130
01:47:17,587 --> 01:47:18,671
Nor do I.

2131
01:47:18,754 --> 01:47:19,797
Proceed.

2132
01:47:19,881 --> 01:47:21,924
(in English)
Well, this passage

2133
01:47:22,008 --> 01:47:24,302
was about a guy imagining
how his life would've been

2134
01:47:24,385 --> 01:47:27,138
without the accident
that killed his brother.

2135
01:47:27,221 --> 01:47:28,681
One day, he wakes up, finds himself

2136
01:47:28,764 --> 01:47:30,266
in two different realities:

2137
01:47:30,349 --> 01:47:32,185
One where the accident
is the center of his life,

2138
01:47:32,268 --> 01:47:34,604
and one where the accident
never happened.

2139
01:47:34,687 --> 01:47:37,148
I told Samuel I loved it.

2140
01:47:37,231 --> 01:47:40,610
He had me read everything
he wrote back then.

2141
01:47:40,693 --> 01:47:43,905
And soon after,
he abandoned the whole book.

2142
01:47:43,988 --> 01:47:46,949
I asked him if I could
use the idea and he said yes.

2143
01:47:47,033 --> 01:47:48,659
No.

2144
01:47:48,743 --> 01:47:51,454
(in French) He couldn't have said yes,
he calls it plundering.

2145
01:47:51,537 --> 01:47:53,372
SANDRA (in English):
It's an argument.

2146
01:47:53,456 --> 01:47:56,542
People exaggerate and alter
facts when they argue.

2147
01:47:56,626 --> 01:47:59,962
(in French) It's no exaggeration to say
his book became yours: <i>Eclipse.</i>

2148
01:48:00,588 --> 01:48:02,507
(scoffs, stammers)

2149
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:04,008
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
Non?

2150
01:48:04,091 --> 01:48:07,803
(in English)
All I took was this idea.

2151
01:48:07,887 --> 01:48:10,681
My characters are a woman
and her daughter,

2152
01:48:10,765 --> 01:48:13,476
and I developed the story
over 300 pages.

2153
01:48:15,228 --> 01:48:17,688
(scoffs)
I can't believe I must tell you

2154
01:48:17,772 --> 01:48:20,399
what is the difference
between an outline and a novel.

2155
01:48:20,483 --> 01:48:23,736
He agreed to it,
and when he read it, he told me

2156
01:48:23,819 --> 01:48:26,322
I-- I did something
very different with it.

2157
01:48:26,405 --> 01:48:28,074
And sometimes,
yes, when we argued,

2158
01:48:28,157 --> 01:48:31,410
it came out,
because he was upset,

2159
01:48:31,494 --> 01:48:33,204
because he couldn't write.

2160
01:48:33,287 --> 01:48:37,083
(in French) The only thing we know
for sure is that "it came out."

2161
01:48:37,166 --> 01:48:38,876
Did the two of you...

2162
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:42,505
argue again
before the time of his death?

2163
01:48:42,588 --> 01:48:44,882
It must've been very tense.

2164
01:48:47,426 --> 01:48:49,679
(in English)
We were...

2165
01:48:49,762 --> 01:48:51,556
We were both really shaken.

2166
01:48:51,639 --> 01:48:53,558
We were
both keeping to ourselves.

2167
01:48:53,641 --> 01:48:56,060
And Samuel, he was...

2168
01:48:56,143 --> 01:48:57,895
I don't know, something was gone,

2169
01:48:57,979 --> 01:49:00,648
he was depleted,
his energy was just gone.

2170
01:49:00,731 --> 01:49:01,816
ADVOCATE GENERAL (in French):
In the audio,

2171
01:49:01,899 --> 01:49:04,485
I hear Samuel Maleski
arguing strenuously.

2172
01:49:04,569 --> 01:49:07,947
I hear a man determined
to regain control of his life.

2173
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:11,075
In no way a man
who has decided to give up.

2174
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:15,788
Samuel's psychiatrist said
he was combative in their last sessions.

2175
01:49:15,872 --> 01:49:20,585
Do you kill yourself after fighting
for time and self-esteem?

2176
01:49:20,668 --> 01:49:25,298
Do you kill yourself after pleading
so fiercely and energetically

2177
01:49:25,381 --> 01:49:28,885
for balance and justice
in your relationship? No.

2178
01:49:29,886 --> 01:49:32,763
That's the main flaw
in the suicide theory.

2179
01:49:32,847 --> 01:49:36,142
You say he seemed "depleted."

2180
01:49:36,225 --> 01:49:37,810
His energy was gone.

2181
01:49:38,144 --> 01:49:42,231
I'd like to read from one of Ms. Voyter's
recent books, <i>The Black House.</i>

2182
01:49:42,315 --> 01:49:44,233
NOUR:
We judge facts, not books.

2183
01:49:44,317 --> 01:49:47,111
Judge, this is a slippery slope.

2184
01:49:47,195 --> 01:49:50,698
In 2017, Sandra Voyter herself
declared, and I quote,

2185
01:49:50,781 --> 01:49:53,993
"My books are linked to my life
and those in it."

2186
01:49:54,076 --> 01:49:57,163
Objection!
She's always said her work is fiction.

2187
01:49:57,580 --> 01:50:00,124
First book is her mother's death!

2188
01:50:00,208 --> 01:50:02,043
Second, a rift with her father.

2189
01:50:02,126 --> 01:50:04,420
Third, her son's accident, etc.

2190
01:50:04,504 --> 01:50:06,672
Her books are part of this trial.

2191
01:50:06,756 --> 01:50:09,717
Her life is in them,
her relationship in particular.

2192
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:11,636
Go ahead, but keep it brief.

2193
01:50:12,303 --> 01:50:15,640
This is a wife
talking about her husband.

2194
01:50:18,267 --> 01:50:21,646
"He'd stopped complaining.
He'd given up.

2195
01:50:21,729 --> 01:50:25,024
"She studied him,
repulsed by his resignation.

2196
01:50:25,733 --> 01:50:29,111
"An idea sprouted in her mind,
a seed of deliverance.

2197
01:50:29,195 --> 01:50:30,780
The possibility of his death."

2198
01:50:30,863 --> 01:50:32,031
NOUR:
Give us the context.

2199
01:50:32,114 --> 01:50:34,033
Later: "How does one kill?"

2200
01:50:34,116 --> 01:50:36,994
"What about the body? Its weight?

2201
01:50:37,078 --> 01:50:38,996
"She could think of nothing else.

2202
01:50:39,789 --> 01:50:43,626
"She saw him dead,
his body a lump no longer desired.

2203
01:50:43,709 --> 01:50:45,545
-(Nour interjects)
-"The body she'd loved

2204
01:50:45,628 --> 01:50:47,964
was now in the way and had to go."

2205
01:50:48,047 --> 01:50:49,966
NOUR:
I'll provide the context.

2206
01:50:50,049 --> 01:50:53,553
This is a minor character going insane

2207
01:50:53,636 --> 01:50:55,721
who doesn't act on her thoughts.

2208
01:50:55,805 --> 01:50:58,307
A novel is not life!
An author is not her characters.

2209
01:50:58,391 --> 01:51:01,769
But an author can express herself
through her characters.

2210
01:51:01,853 --> 01:51:03,396
You flagged this passage.

2211
01:51:03,479 --> 01:51:05,439
How can we not see a link?

2212
01:51:05,523 --> 01:51:07,567
Is Stephen King a serial killer?

2213
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:10,736
ADVOCATE GENERAL: Did his wife
turn up dead in suspicious circumstances?

2214
01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:12,071
Focus on the facts!

2215
01:51:12,154 --> 01:51:15,575
Mr. Renzi, I strongly advise you
to calm down.

2216
01:51:15,658 --> 01:51:19,495
Prosecutor, I advise you
to follow Mr. Renzi's advice.

2217
01:51:19,579 --> 01:51:21,747
Focus on the facts.

2218
01:51:25,001 --> 01:51:26,752
Aside from the slap

2219
01:51:26,836 --> 01:51:29,338
you admitted to,
did you ever hit your husband?

2220
01:51:29,422 --> 01:51:31,048
-SANDRA: Non.
-ADVOCATE GENERAL: Non? Never?

2221
01:51:31,132 --> 01:51:32,008
SANDRA: Non.

2222
01:51:32,091 --> 01:51:33,176
-ADVOCATE GENERAL: That was it?
-Oui.

2223
01:51:33,467 --> 01:51:36,179
You were always a good,
admirable soul,

2224
01:51:37,013 --> 01:51:38,890
altruistic, reasonable,

2225
01:51:38,973 --> 01:51:41,184
trying to save him from himself,

2226
01:51:41,267 --> 01:51:43,352
except on this recording?
Rotten luck!

2227
01:51:43,436 --> 01:51:44,812
(gallery murmuring)

2228
01:51:45,396 --> 01:51:47,481
Any more questions for the witness?

2229
01:51:47,565 --> 01:51:49,692
VINCENT:
I have one more, if I may.

2230
01:51:50,985 --> 01:51:53,654
I'd like to know if Maleski

2231
01:51:53,738 --> 01:51:55,865
sent the transcripts to anyone?

2232
01:51:55,948 --> 01:51:58,659
He sent them to a publisher friend,
Paul Nachez,

2233
01:51:58,743 --> 01:52:00,536
slated to publish his first novel.

2234
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:04,624
Email from August 9, 2017:
"I'm writing again, I need your eye.

2235
01:52:04,707 --> 01:52:06,250
Still rough, eager to talk."

2236
01:52:06,334 --> 01:52:07,668
Nachez's response:

2237
01:52:07,752 --> 01:52:10,129
"Sure, send it and I'll read it."

2238
01:52:10,213 --> 01:52:13,257
Up to his death,
Maleski sent four texts a week.

2239
01:52:13,341 --> 01:52:15,259
What was their communication like?

2240
01:52:15,343 --> 01:52:17,011
CHIEF INVESTIGATOR:
The publisher never replied.

2241
01:52:17,845 --> 01:52:20,556
Apparently he was busy
and the project mystified him.

2242
01:52:21,265 --> 01:52:23,017
His friend's silence

2243
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:26,687
must've hurt Mr. Maleski's
already low self-esteem.

2244
01:52:27,438 --> 01:52:28,981
He feels rejected.

2245
01:52:29,482 --> 01:52:32,318
When we read all the writing he sent,

2246
01:52:32,401 --> 01:52:34,779
it's difficult to identify a storyline.

2247
01:52:34,862 --> 01:52:36,531
At best, it's a project.

2248
01:52:36,614 --> 01:52:38,199
Maleski is a "project man."

2249
01:52:38,282 --> 01:52:40,785
His first abandoned novel,
the chalet...

2250
01:52:41,494 --> 01:52:45,540
So, since we're being asked
to mix justice and literature,

2251
01:52:45,623 --> 01:52:47,583
to imagine what we don't know,

2252
01:52:47,667 --> 01:52:51,546
let's imagine
Samuel Maleski's final year.

2253
01:52:51,629 --> 01:52:53,548
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
And I'm dabbling in fantasy?

2254
01:52:53,631 --> 01:52:55,842
VINCENT: Give me half the time
you took to read a book!

2255
01:52:55,925 --> 01:52:57,593
(Advocate General responds)

2256
01:52:57,677 --> 01:52:59,011
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Get to the point.

2257
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:01,848
What was
Samuel Maleski's final year like?

2258
01:53:03,266 --> 01:53:07,520
After accumulating debt
from medical procedures in London,

2259
01:53:07,603 --> 01:53:10,731
he insists on returning
to his hometown.

2260
01:53:10,815 --> 01:53:14,485
He finds a chalet to fix up and rent.
They'll pay off their debts.

2261
01:53:14,569 --> 01:53:17,530
He'll quit teaching
and start writing full-time.

2262
01:53:17,947 --> 01:53:21,868
Renovation proves tricky.
They have to take out a loan.

2263
01:53:22,451 --> 01:53:24,537
A vicious circle begins.

2264
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:28,708
Samuel needs his teaching wages.
Renovations drag on.

2265
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:31,043
A year and a half later,

2266
01:53:31,127 --> 01:53:32,503
he feels trapped.

2267
01:53:32,837 --> 01:53:34,505
He's a wounded man.

2268
01:53:34,589 --> 01:53:36,465
His son's accident,
his abandoned novel,

2269
01:53:36,549 --> 01:53:38,926
his wife publishing book after book...

2270
01:53:39,677 --> 01:53:41,095
He must write!

2271
01:53:43,431 --> 01:53:46,851
He quits the antidepressants
and starts recording his life,

2272
01:53:46,934 --> 01:53:49,604
embarking on a kind of autofiction,

2273
01:53:49,687 --> 01:53:52,815
perhaps inspired by Sandra's method.

2274
01:53:52,899 --> 01:53:55,902
And why not?
She borrows from their lives.

2275
01:53:55,985 --> 01:53:58,070
She did borrow his idea.

2276
01:53:58,154 --> 01:53:59,488
Save it for your plea.

2277
01:53:59,572 --> 01:54:03,659
VINCENT: He's running,
but refuses to see that transcribing

2278
01:54:03,743 --> 01:54:04,869
is not writing.

2279
01:54:04,952 --> 01:54:07,622
His publisher friend's silence
humiliates him.

2280
01:54:08,873 --> 01:54:11,792
What do we hear
in the March 4th fight?

2281
01:54:12,126 --> 01:54:15,087
The energy, the willfulness...
What is it?

2282
01:54:15,463 --> 01:54:17,131
The energy of despair.

2283
01:54:17,215 --> 01:54:20,051
The final push before giving up.

2284
01:54:23,346 --> 01:54:27,600
In his final days, this man
isn't facing a war in his marriage.

2285
01:54:28,809 --> 01:54:30,895
He's facing his own failures.

2286
01:54:32,605 --> 01:54:34,815
Sandra Voyter is only guilty

2287
01:54:34,899 --> 01:54:37,568
of succeeding
where her husband failed.

2288
01:54:41,614 --> 01:54:46,035
Despite appearances, those were
not Mr. Renzi's closing arguments.

2289
01:54:46,118 --> 01:54:47,286
(gallery murmuring)

2290
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:48,538
SANDRA (in English):
That was not Samuel--

2291
01:54:48,621 --> 01:54:50,790
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Bon. It's Friday evening,

2292
01:54:50,873 --> 01:54:52,834
we have a weekend ahead of us.

2293
01:54:53,501 --> 01:54:56,128
Before I adjourn,
I have an announcement.

2294
01:54:56,212 --> 01:54:59,549
I've decided to call Daniel
back to the bar on Monday.

2295
01:54:59,966 --> 01:55:02,385
He has new information of interest.

2296
01:55:02,468 --> 01:55:05,972
Since the witness
is the defendant's son

2297
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:08,766
-and lives with his mother...
-(Nour whispering)

2298
01:55:08,850 --> 01:55:12,019
I'm asking everyone
to refrain from contacting him.

2299
01:55:12,478 --> 01:55:15,982
Obviously, if contact is inevitable,

2300
01:55:16,065 --> 01:55:19,068
refrain from discussing the trial.

2301
01:55:19,151 --> 01:55:20,486
Ms. Berger,

2302
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:23,656
you'll stay with Daniel all weekend.

2303
01:55:24,657 --> 01:55:28,202
See to it these rules are respected.

2304
01:55:28,286 --> 01:55:30,204
I insist that no one,

2305
01:55:30,288 --> 01:55:33,833
absolutely no one,
can ask him about his testimony.

2306
01:55:33,916 --> 01:55:35,376
Voilà.

2307
01:55:35,459 --> 01:55:37,753
Have a good weekend,
get some rest.

2308
01:55:37,837 --> 01:55:39,547
Court is adjourned.

2309
01:55:39,630 --> 01:55:41,674
(people chattering and moving about)

2310
01:56:27,678 --> 01:56:29,847
-(in French) Come get warm.
-SANDRA (in French): Ready in 10!

2311
01:56:36,145 --> 01:56:37,230
MARGE (in French):
You okay?

2312
01:56:43,194 --> 01:56:44,529
DANIEL (in French):
I think...

2313
01:56:44,612 --> 01:56:46,697
I think I want to be alone.

2314
01:56:48,157 --> 01:56:49,325
MARGE:
Okay.

2315
01:56:51,035 --> 01:56:53,412
-MARGE: You can eat in your room.
-DANIEL: No.

2316
01:56:53,496 --> 01:56:55,373
I want to be alone this weekend.

2317
01:56:55,873 --> 01:56:57,083
Before I testify.

2318
01:56:57,166 --> 01:56:58,167
MARGE:
Alone?

2319
01:56:58,251 --> 01:56:59,877
Just you and me?

2320
01:57:00,878 --> 01:57:02,004
Is that it?

2321
01:57:03,506 --> 01:57:05,258
Are you sure?

2322
01:57:06,342 --> 01:57:09,595
We can find other solutions.
It's a big house.

2323
01:57:10,221 --> 01:57:11,722
DANIEL:
I want her to leave.

2324
01:57:13,182 --> 01:57:14,267
MARGE (whispers):
Okay.

2325
01:57:20,314 --> 01:57:21,274
MARGE: Sandra...

2326
01:57:22,692 --> 01:57:24,235
MARGE:
I just spoke to Daniel.

2327
01:57:25,319 --> 01:57:28,072
He wants to be alone this weekend.

2328
01:57:28,155 --> 01:57:29,866
Until the end of the trial.

2329
01:57:30,992 --> 01:57:31,993
SANDRA:
Oh.

2330
01:57:33,202 --> 01:57:34,370
SANDRA:
Daniel?

2331
01:57:44,172 --> 01:57:46,257
(in English)
Is-- Is that what you want?

2332
01:57:51,262 --> 01:57:53,055
Okay, is it because
of what you heard today?

2333
01:57:53,139 --> 01:57:55,224
Because, uh...
I couldn't talk to you

2334
01:57:55,308 --> 01:57:57,310
about all that before,
do you understand?

2335
01:57:57,393 --> 01:57:59,103
We just weren't allowed
to talk to you about it...

2336
01:57:59,187 --> 01:58:00,479
MARGE (in French):
Please...

2337
01:58:01,189 --> 01:58:02,398
No trial talk.

2338
01:58:02,481 --> 01:58:05,276
(in French)
I know, I'm just talking to my son.

2339
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:09,030
(in English)
Okay? Um, I totally understand

2340
01:58:09,113 --> 01:58:12,283
that you need calm, but I can
just mind my own business,

2341
01:58:12,366 --> 01:58:14,660
keep to myself-- I won't talk
to you if you don't want to.

2342
01:58:14,744 --> 01:58:16,746
-MARGE (in French): Wait.
-(in English) Can we try that?

2343
01:58:16,829 --> 01:58:17,997
MARGE (in French):
No speaking English.

2344
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:21,083
SANDRA (in French):
Daniel, you can talk to me.

2345
01:58:22,168 --> 01:58:26,339
Couldn't you and I discuss this,
and then you decide?

2346
01:58:28,508 --> 01:58:30,510
MARGE:
I think he's made his decision.

2347
01:58:39,227 --> 01:58:41,187
Um...

2348
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:43,481
(in English) Yeah, I will
just get my, my stuff.

2349
01:59:10,007 --> 01:59:13,052
(in English)
Somebody said, "Of course,

2350
01:59:13,135 --> 01:59:15,096
"money doesn't make you happy,

2351
01:59:15,179 --> 01:59:18,766
but it's still better to, to cry
in a car than in the subway."

2352
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:22,228
(Vincent and Sandra laughing)

2353
01:59:22,311 --> 01:59:23,479
VINCENT (in English):
Who said that?

2354
01:59:23,563 --> 01:59:25,481
SANDRA:
I don't know.

2355
01:59:29,777 --> 01:59:32,154
(both laugh)

2356
01:59:41,706 --> 01:59:43,040
(Sandra deeply sighs)

2357
01:59:46,210 --> 01:59:47,670
(sobbing)

2358
02:00:26,542 --> 02:00:27,793
SANDRA (in French):
Sorry.

2359
02:00:32,548 --> 02:00:34,425
(muffled chattering outside)

2360
02:00:43,935 --> 02:00:46,020
(Snoop's paws clacking on floor)

2361
02:00:53,486 --> 02:00:54,529
DANIEL (in French):
Go on.

2362
02:01:01,410 --> 02:01:02,703
Eat up.

2363
02:01:05,331 --> 02:01:06,666
(kisses)

2364
02:01:10,127 --> 02:01:12,088
(rain pattering on window)

2365
02:01:30,565 --> 02:01:31,858
(dishes clattering in distance)

2366
02:01:31,941 --> 02:01:33,067
(whispers)
Snoop...

2367
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:34,610
(Snoop breathing lightly)

2368
02:01:34,694 --> 02:01:38,072
(louder)
Snoop? Snoop? Snoop?

2369
02:01:38,155 --> 02:01:39,365
(Daniel panting and gasping)

2370
02:01:39,448 --> 02:01:41,617
-(Snoop grunting softly)
-Snoop?

2371
02:01:45,288 --> 02:01:46,455
Marge!

2372
02:01:48,875 --> 02:01:51,169
Marge, come quick, please!

2373
02:01:54,005 --> 02:01:55,256
Snoop?

2374
02:01:55,339 --> 02:01:57,633
-(Daniel sobbing)
-(footsteps approaching)

2375
02:01:57,717 --> 02:01:59,093
MARGE: What is it?

2376
02:02:01,637 --> 02:02:04,140
I gave him aspirin,
I messed up bad.

2377
02:02:05,224 --> 02:02:07,351
-MARGE: You gave him aspirin?
-DANIEL: Yes!

2378
02:02:07,435 --> 02:02:09,061
MARGE: How much?

2379
02:02:09,145 --> 02:02:11,606
DANIEL:
Eight or ten, I can't remember.

2380
02:02:11,689 --> 02:02:12,773
A lot.

2381
02:02:13,566 --> 02:02:15,026
DANIEL:
Make him vomit.

2382
02:02:15,109 --> 02:02:16,986
MARGE:
Why'd you do that?

2383
02:02:17,069 --> 02:02:18,029
DANIEL:
Make him vomit!

2384
02:02:18,112 --> 02:02:19,906
-Please!
-MARGE: Okay, hang on.

2385
02:02:19,989 --> 02:02:21,616
(Marge sighs deeply)

2386
02:02:22,241 --> 02:02:23,534
"Make a dog vomit."

2387
02:02:24,118 --> 02:02:25,411
MARGE: Hang on.

2388
02:02:25,494 --> 02:02:28,164
We need saltwater.
Be right back.

2389
02:02:28,247 --> 02:02:29,832
(Daniel continues sobbing)

2390
02:02:30,708 --> 02:02:32,043
(faucet running nearby)

2391
02:02:38,341 --> 02:02:39,550
DANIEL: He's not moving!

2392
02:02:39,634 --> 02:02:41,219
Daniel, help me.

2393
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:43,846
Open his mouth.

2394
02:02:44,722 --> 02:02:45,723
Easy. Easy.

2395
02:02:51,729 --> 02:02:55,233
(Marge speaking French)

2396
02:02:55,316 --> 02:02:56,859
MARGE: That's right.

2397
02:02:56,943 --> 02:03:02,240
(Marge speaking French)

2398
02:03:02,323 --> 02:03:03,574
MARGE: That's good.

2399
02:03:03,658 --> 02:03:06,118
(Marge speaks French)

2400
02:03:06,202 --> 02:03:07,954
MARGE:
He's coming around.

2401
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:13,084
-What's happening?
-He's going to vomit.

2402
02:03:13,751 --> 02:03:14,919
(wretches)

2403
02:03:15,002 --> 02:03:16,212
(Marge speaks French)

2404
02:03:17,213 --> 02:03:18,881
(Marge vocalizes calming noises)

2405
02:03:18,965 --> 02:03:20,007
MARGE (whispering):
That's it.

2406
02:03:20,091 --> 02:03:21,425
He'll be okay.

2407
02:03:23,261 --> 02:03:25,096
(Marge speaks French)

2408
02:03:25,179 --> 02:03:26,597
MARGE:
Good dog.

2409
02:03:26,681 --> 02:03:30,393
(Marge speaks French)

2410
02:03:30,476 --> 02:03:31,853
Oh, oui.

2411
02:03:31,936 --> 02:03:34,605
(Marge speaks French)

2412
02:03:34,689 --> 02:03:37,525
MARGE: He's okay, he's breathing.
Looking at us.

2413
02:03:37,608 --> 02:03:40,486
(Marge speaks French, sighs)

2414
02:03:42,947 --> 02:03:44,198
MARGE: Can you explain?

2415
02:03:44,282 --> 02:03:45,491
(Daniel sobbing)

2416
02:03:47,994 --> 02:03:49,370
DANIEL: You know, I...

2417
02:03:50,079 --> 02:03:52,123
I'd never heard about...

2418
02:03:53,583 --> 02:03:55,751
my dad's suicide attempt.

2419
02:03:56,878 --> 02:03:59,213
I'd never heard about...

2420
02:03:59,964 --> 02:04:02,717
the shrink, the medicine...

2421
02:04:03,634 --> 02:04:04,886
the vomit and aspirin.

2422
02:04:06,012 --> 02:04:08,806
When my mom talked about it,
I remembered something

2423
02:04:08,890 --> 02:04:10,474
from around that time.

2424
02:04:11,559 --> 02:04:12,810
One morning,

2425
02:04:12,894 --> 02:04:15,229
Snoop was lying on my bedroom floor.

2426
02:04:15,313 --> 02:04:17,481
Not moving.
He smelled like vomit.

2427
02:04:19,483 --> 02:04:21,527
I figured he'd vomited.

2428
02:04:22,987 --> 02:04:24,822
I cleaned his muzzle.

2429
02:04:25,865 --> 02:04:28,034
I figured he'd...

2430
02:04:28,534 --> 02:04:32,288
I don't know, caught a virus
or something, because...

2431
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:35,625
he acted strange for days.

2432
02:04:35,875 --> 02:04:37,960
He just slept or drank.

2433
02:04:38,961 --> 02:04:43,299
See? Now I'm thinking
maybe he ate my dad's vomit,

2434
02:04:43,382 --> 02:04:44,967
and that made him sick,

2435
02:04:45,051 --> 02:04:47,094
and Mom told the truth!

2436
02:04:48,638 --> 02:04:51,557
So my experiment with the aspirin

2437
02:04:51,641 --> 02:04:53,684
was to see how he'd react.

2438
02:04:53,768 --> 02:04:54,936
And you saw.

2439
02:04:55,019 --> 02:04:58,731
He slept for 14 hours.
Now he's drinking all the time.

2440
02:04:58,814 --> 02:05:00,816
He smells exactly the same!

2441
02:05:01,484 --> 02:05:02,401
Everything!

2442
02:05:02,485 --> 02:05:04,529
Everything's exactly the same!

2443
02:05:06,113 --> 02:05:07,615
But since...

2444
02:05:08,241 --> 02:05:11,577
since yesterday,
I'm not sure if I believe her or not.

2445
02:05:11,827 --> 02:05:13,704
I knew they fought, but...

2446
02:05:18,209 --> 02:05:19,752
It wasn't...

2447
02:05:20,878 --> 02:05:23,506
I didn't think it was that violent.

2448
02:05:23,589 --> 02:05:25,424
MARGE:
Bon...

2449
02:05:25,508 --> 02:05:27,969
Your memories are all you're sure of,

2450
02:05:28,052 --> 02:05:30,137
and it's important to tell the jury.

2451
02:05:30,221 --> 02:05:32,098
But you're just a witness.

2452
02:05:32,181 --> 02:05:34,475
DANIEL: Do you think
she could've killed him?

2453
02:05:36,352 --> 02:05:37,895
(Marge sighs)

2454
02:05:37,979 --> 02:05:39,480
MARGE:
It's not for me to judge.

2455
02:05:39,564 --> 02:05:42,608
I know, but you
could at least tell me!

2456
02:05:42,692 --> 02:05:46,070
I can't answer that.
My role is to protect you...

2457
02:05:46,153 --> 02:05:47,947
Fucking help me!

2458
02:06:25,276 --> 02:06:26,569
MARGE: Actually,

2459
02:06:26,652 --> 02:06:28,946
when we lack an element

2460
02:06:29,030 --> 02:06:31,657
to judge something,
and the lack is unbearable,

2461
02:06:32,658 --> 02:06:34,744
all we can do is decide.

2462
02:06:36,245 --> 02:06:37,413
You see?

2463
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:41,000
To overcome doubt,
sometimes we have to...

2464
02:06:41,083 --> 02:06:43,753
decide to sway
one way rather than the other.

2465
02:06:45,713 --> 02:06:49,717
Since you need to believe one thing
but have two choices,

2466
02:06:49,800 --> 02:06:51,302
you must choose.

2467
02:06:52,386 --> 02:06:54,597
So you have to invent your belief?

2468
02:06:54,931 --> 02:06:57,099
MARGE:
Yes, well... in a sense.

2469
02:06:57,183 --> 02:07:00,019
So that means, I'm not sure...

2470
02:07:00,937 --> 02:07:03,481
and you're saying
I have to pretend I'm sure?

2471
02:07:03,564 --> 02:07:04,732
MARGE: No.

2472
02:07:05,358 --> 02:07:07,360
No, I'm saying decide.

2473
02:07:09,028 --> 02:07:10,613
That's different.

2474
02:07:42,270 --> 02:07:44,397
LITERARY CRITIC (on TV):
<i>What strikes me is</i>

2475
02:07:44,480 --> 02:07:46,023
<i>we don't know who's more lyrical.</i>

2476
02:07:46,107 --> 02:07:49,026
<i>-The author or the character?
-Both, no doubt!</i>

2477
02:07:49,110 --> 02:07:50,987
<i>Voyter plays with confusion.</i>

2478
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:53,030
<i>Her second book goes further,</i>

2479
02:07:53,114 --> 02:07:56,367
<i>telling how her father
couldn't stand the first.</i>

2480
02:07:56,450 --> 02:07:57,660
<i>Undoubtedly true.</i>

2481
02:07:57,743 --> 02:08:01,622
<i>The rift degenerates,
forcing her to leave her country.</i>

2482
02:08:01,706 --> 02:08:05,877
<i>Fearing her father's rage,
she falls prey to horrifying visions.</i>

2483
02:08:05,960 --> 02:08:10,339
<i>I found this troubling quote
in an interview. She says,</i>

2484
02:08:10,423 --> 02:08:12,592
<i>"My job is to cover the tracks,</i>

2485
02:08:12,675 --> 02:08:15,595
<i>so fiction can destroy reality."</i>

2486
02:08:17,013 --> 02:08:18,931
LITERARY CRITIC:
<i>Yes, and what excites people</i>

2487
02:08:19,015 --> 02:08:21,184
<i>about the Samuel Maleski case,</i>

2488
02:08:21,267 --> 02:08:24,270
<i>is that it seems to come
from one of her books.</i>

2489
02:08:24,353 --> 02:08:26,856
<i>It feels like she's already written it.</i>

2490
02:08:26,939 --> 02:08:30,693
<i>Even the doubts surrounding
his death, the way he died,</i>

2491
02:08:30,776 --> 02:08:34,197
<i>Voyter's murky personality,
the amoral, deceptive traits</i>

2492
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:35,740
<i>she seems to overplay...</i>

2493
02:08:35,823 --> 02:08:38,367
<i>It all reads like her books.</i>

2494
02:08:38,451 --> 02:08:40,953
<i>I don't think it matters how he died.</i>

2495
02:08:41,037 --> 02:08:44,707
<i>The fact is, the idea of
a writer killing her husband</i>

2496
02:08:44,790 --> 02:08:48,586
<i>is far more compelling
than a teacher killing himself.</i>

2497
02:08:48,669 --> 02:08:49,712
(turns off TV)

2498
02:08:59,889 --> 02:09:02,934
(playing Chopin's
"Opus 28 No. 4")

2499
02:10:03,494 --> 02:10:06,831
<i>(Daniel continues
playing composition)</i>

2500
02:10:54,295 --> 02:10:55,546
(piano stops)

2501
02:10:59,217 --> 02:11:01,928
If I imagine my mother doing it,
I don't understand.

2502
02:11:04,388 --> 02:11:06,307
But if I imagine my father...

2503
02:11:08,559 --> 02:11:10,770
I think I can understand.

2504
02:11:16,984 --> 02:11:19,153
JUSTICE MINISTER:
Prosecutor, any questions?

2505
02:11:19,987 --> 02:11:22,031
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
Bon...

2506
02:11:22,114 --> 02:11:24,909
The experiment on his dog
proves nothing.

2507
02:11:24,992 --> 02:11:26,869
It's not documented.

2508
02:11:26,953 --> 02:11:29,956
More problematic
are these providential memories,

2509
02:11:30,039 --> 02:11:33,417
clearly jarred
by what he heard during the trial.

2510
02:11:34,043 --> 02:11:37,255
No event can be placed
convincingly on our timeline.

2511
02:11:37,338 --> 02:11:40,007
The timeframe of six months
before Maleski's death

2512
02:11:40,091 --> 02:11:44,220
comes from testimony
given by the defendant herself.

2513
02:11:47,974 --> 02:11:49,392
I'd like to know...

2514
02:11:53,104 --> 02:11:54,272
Daniel...

2515
02:11:56,065 --> 02:11:57,567
Did you ever wonder

2516
02:11:57,650 --> 02:12:00,695
if the overdose
your father supposedly took

2517
02:12:00,778 --> 02:12:04,282
might've resulted
not from a suicide attempt,

2518
02:12:04,365 --> 02:12:07,285
but from an attempt
by your mother to poison him?

2519
02:12:07,368 --> 02:12:10,162
I'm not accusing,
just making a point.

2520
02:12:10,246 --> 02:12:12,748
So, taking these speculations,

2521
02:12:12,832 --> 02:12:15,501
why choose one over the other?

2522
02:12:15,585 --> 02:12:19,672
Your memories speak to
the consequences, not the causes.

2523
02:12:20,882 --> 02:12:23,217
DANIEL:
Yes, I thought about that, but...

2524
02:12:24,177 --> 02:12:26,596
I don't see why
she would've done it.

2525
02:12:27,138 --> 02:12:29,640
It feels like when we lack proof

2526
02:12:29,724 --> 02:12:32,393
to make us sure
how something happened,

2527
02:12:32,935 --> 02:12:35,855
we have to look further,
as the trial is doing.

2528
02:12:36,606 --> 02:12:40,026
When we've looked everywhere
and still don't understand

2529
02:12:40,109 --> 02:12:42,653
how the thing happened,

2530
02:12:42,737 --> 02:12:45,615
I think we have to ask
why it happened.

2531
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:51,913
Thank you, Daniel.

2532
02:12:52,747 --> 02:12:53,873
Are you finished?

2533
02:13:02,298 --> 02:13:03,257
No.

2534
02:13:05,176 --> 02:13:06,928
I want to say something else.

2535
02:13:14,018 --> 02:13:18,439
Since my dog was sick for days,
Dad and I went to the vet.

2536
02:13:19,899 --> 02:13:22,109
Dad was really quiet in the car.

2537
02:13:22,193 --> 02:13:25,655
He didn't even play music.
He usually always does.

2538
02:13:28,074 --> 02:13:31,035
After a while,
he started talking about Snoop.

2539
02:13:32,620 --> 02:13:33,746
He said...

2540
02:13:33,829 --> 02:13:35,456
DANIEL:
<i>"You know, he could get sick.</i>

2541
02:13:36,249 --> 02:13:39,502
<i>"Even die. You know that.
You need to be ready."</i>

2542
02:13:41,087 --> 02:13:42,713
<i>I didn't want to hear that.</i>

2543
02:13:43,464 --> 02:13:46,801
<i>Snoop was doing better.
He was still young.</i>

2544
02:13:46,884 --> 02:13:48,135
<i>He'd never been sick.</i>

2545
02:13:48,219 --> 02:13:50,471
<i>I told him he wasn't going to die.</i>

2546
02:13:52,557 --> 02:13:53,933
But he kept going.

2547
02:13:54,475 --> 02:13:58,729
He said, "You need to be aware of it.
It'll happen someday.

2548
02:13:59,689 --> 02:14:02,775
"And it's no wonder Snoop gets tired.

2549
02:14:02,859 --> 02:14:04,861
"He's not so young in dog years.

2550
02:14:08,072 --> 02:14:09,740
DANIEL: <i>"Can you imagine his life?</i>

2551
02:14:11,826 --> 02:14:13,536
<i>"He's not just any dog.</i>

2552
02:14:14,620 --> 02:14:16,205
<i>"He's a great dog.</i>

2553
02:14:17,748 --> 02:14:19,625
<i>"An outstanding dog.</i>

2554
02:14:20,626 --> 02:14:23,588
<i>"Think about it.
He anticipates your needs,</i>

2555
02:14:24,005 --> 02:14:26,215
<i>"foresees your movements,</i>

2556
02:14:26,799 --> 02:14:28,551
<i>"keeps you safe from danger.</i>

2557
02:14:30,344 --> 02:14:32,680
<i>"He spends his life
imagining your needs,</i>

2558
02:14:32,763 --> 02:14:35,057
<i>"thinking about what you can't see.</i>

2559
02:14:38,644 --> 02:14:40,062
<i>"Maybe he's tired.</i>

2560
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:42,148
<i>"Always caring for others.</i>

2561
02:14:42,940 --> 02:14:44,901
<i>"Maybe one day, he'll be done.</i>

2562
02:14:45,776 --> 02:14:47,069
<i>That could happen."</i>

2563
02:14:52,158 --> 02:14:54,035
And I remember at the end,

2564
02:14:55,870 --> 02:14:57,914
he said, "One day,

2565
02:14:57,997 --> 02:15:00,958
"when it's time
for him to go, he'll go.

2566
02:15:02,084 --> 02:15:05,755
"You won't be able to help it.
Prepare yourself, it'll be hard.

2567
02:15:05,838 --> 02:15:08,090
But it won't be the end of your life."

2568
02:15:14,764 --> 02:15:16,307
He meant himself.

2569
02:15:17,141 --> 02:15:18,392
Now...

2570
02:15:19,810 --> 02:15:21,938
Now I know he meant himself.

2571
02:15:26,901 --> 02:15:27,777
ADVOCATE GENERAL:
Bon.

2572
02:15:28,653 --> 02:15:31,948
I implore the jurors to bear in mind

2573
02:15:32,031 --> 02:15:33,991
this story is extremely subjective.

2574
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:38,621
In no way does it qualify
as any form of proof.

2575
02:15:53,511 --> 02:15:54,679
(people chattering)

2576
02:15:59,016 --> 02:16:02,979
Yes, Serge, we are still outside
the courthouse in Grenoble.

2577
02:16:03,062 --> 02:16:06,065
The trial was scheduled
to end on Friday,

2578
02:16:06,148 --> 02:16:08,692
but Sandra Voyter's son Daniel

2579
02:16:08,776 --> 02:16:11,195
insisted on testifying again
this morning.

2580
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:12,989
The jury is still...

2581
02:16:13,072 --> 02:16:14,740
(Daniel playing Chopin's
"Opus 28 No. 4")

2582
02:16:14,824 --> 02:16:16,868
(Snoop panting;
paws clacking on floor)

2583
02:16:18,952 --> 02:16:20,663

MARGE: Daniel!

2586
02:16:30,047 --> 02:16:33,425
REPORTER 1 (on TV):
<i>Ms. Voyter, how do you feel...</i>

2587
02:16:33,885 --> 02:16:36,012
<i>after being acquitted?</i>

2588
02:16:36,094 --> 02:16:37,013
SANDRA: <i>Uh...</i>

2589
02:16:37,096 --> 02:16:40,683
<i>There were too many words
in this trial.</i>

2590
02:16:41,017 --> 02:16:42,434
{\an8}<i>I've nothing more to say.</i>

2591
02:16:42,934 --> 02:16:46,355
{\an8}<i>I want to call my son and go home.</i>

2592
02:16:47,272 --> 02:16:51,402
<i>Obviously I thank my lawyers,
who always believed in me.</i>

2593
02:16:51,485 --> 02:16:54,197
REPORTER 1:
<i>Mr. Renzi, are you relieved?</i>

2594
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:56,449
VINCENT:
<i>I commend the jury...</i>

2595
02:16:56,531 --> 02:16:59,326
-(reporters clamoring)
-who <i>saw Sandra Voyter as she is...</i>

2596
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:02,996
(clamoring continues)

2597
02:17:10,338 --> 02:17:11,880
(Marge speaking indistinctly)

2598
02:17:16,886 --> 02:17:19,096
(reporters clamoring)

2599
02:17:50,002 --> 02:17:51,379
(sighs)

2600
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:03,014
SANDRA (in French):
Marge, it's Sandra.

2601
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:07,937
(Sandra laughs)
Yes, it's incredible, we're relieved.

2602
02:18:08,020 --> 02:18:09,355
Oui.

2603
02:18:11,732 --> 02:18:13,942
Does Daniel want to talk to me?

2604
02:18:16,404 --> 02:18:18,781
Of course, he must be tired,

2605
02:18:18,865 --> 02:18:20,074
I understand.

2606
02:18:21,909 --> 02:18:24,954
Does he mind if I come home tonight?

2607
02:18:25,037 --> 02:18:26,914
Would he prefer tomorrow, or...

2608
02:18:31,502 --> 02:18:32,587
Okay.

2609
02:18:32,837 --> 02:18:34,172
Okay. Okay. Okay.

2610
02:18:34,254 --> 02:18:37,842
We'll get some dinner,
then I'll be home. See you then.

2611
02:18:37,924 --> 02:18:39,427
(Sandra happily moans)

2612
02:18:41,094 --> 02:18:42,847
SANDRA (in English):
I need a drink.

2613
02:18:42,930 --> 02:18:45,433
(both laugh)

2614
02:18:47,393 --> 02:18:48,394
(in English)
Another!

2615
02:18:48,477 --> 02:18:50,188
(laughter)

2616
02:18:52,481 --> 02:18:53,858
(in English)
Okay, deal!

2617
02:18:55,692 --> 02:18:57,486
(stammers)

2618
02:18:57,570 --> 02:18:59,530
Do you always... Do you...

2619
02:18:59,614 --> 02:19:01,574
When you win,
do you always, like that?

2620
02:19:01,656 --> 02:19:03,284
-I mean, this is happening...
-VINCENT: We never win.

2621
02:19:03,367 --> 02:19:05,244
(laughter)

2622
02:19:05,327 --> 02:19:06,745
VINCENT:
That's the fucking first time

2623
02:19:06,829 --> 02:19:08,289
in our life we win!

2624
02:19:08,371 --> 02:19:09,790
-No...
-VINCENT: Yes. Of course!

2625
02:19:09,874 --> 02:19:11,459
You told me
you're a good lawyer,

2626
02:19:11,541 --> 02:19:12,834
and what is happening now?

2627
02:19:12,919 --> 02:19:15,338
(laughter)

2628
02:19:15,421 --> 02:19:16,755
-SANDRA: No, that's not true!
-No?

2629
02:19:16,839 --> 02:19:18,049
VINCENT:
It's not spicy.

2630
02:19:18,132 --> 02:19:19,759
SANDRA:
You have to try this, really.

2631
02:19:19,842 --> 02:19:21,093
VINCENT:
Sandra, I ate too much.

2632
02:19:21,177 --> 02:19:22,512
YOUNG FEMALE LAWYER:
I'm gonna throw up.

2633
02:19:22,594 --> 02:19:24,138
(in French)
A quick smoke first.

2634
02:19:24,513 --> 02:19:25,640
Be right back.

2635
02:19:28,184 --> 02:19:31,479
VINCENT (in English):
Okay, no, that you first, please.

2636
02:19:31,562 --> 02:19:33,898
-(bell rings nearby)
-(people chattering)

2637
02:19:45,326 --> 02:19:46,786
It's not so easy, no?

2638
02:19:46,869 --> 02:19:50,456
No. It's not,
it's with all the bones and...

2639
02:19:55,002 --> 02:19:56,796
After this, we go?

2640
02:19:56,879 --> 02:19:59,215
You're ready to go home?

2641
02:19:59,298 --> 02:20:00,550
I can... I can drive.

2642
02:20:00,633 --> 02:20:02,844
I can... I can drop you off.

2643
02:20:02,927 --> 02:20:04,387
SANDRA:
One more.

2644
02:20:04,470 --> 02:20:06,013
For... For the road.

2645
02:20:06,097 --> 02:20:07,682
(both chuckle)

2646
02:20:07,765 --> 02:20:09,225
VINCENT: Of course,
for the driver.

2647
02:20:10,476 --> 02:20:11,644
VINCENT: Okay, same?

2648
02:20:11,727 --> 02:20:13,396
-SANDRA: Mm-hmm.
-(sake cups clattering)

2649
02:20:13,479 --> 02:20:14,647
(Vincent clears throat)

2650
02:20:19,944 --> 02:20:21,821
VINCENT (in French):
Can I just get...

2651
02:20:21,904 --> 02:20:24,073
two more of these? Thanks.

2652
02:20:27,910 --> 02:20:28,995
VINCENT (whispers):
Merci, monsieur.

2653
02:20:29,078 --> 02:20:30,538
(Vincent speaks French)

2654
02:20:35,209 --> 02:20:37,253
-VINCENT: Okay.
-SANDRA: Okay.

2655
02:20:38,588 --> 02:20:40,214
-(sighs) Yeah.
-(sighs) Yeah.

2656
02:20:40,298 --> 02:20:42,049
-To you.
-To you.

2657
02:20:49,015 --> 02:20:50,057
(Vincent clears throat)

2658
02:20:56,647 --> 02:20:57,940
Are you all right?

2659
02:20:58,024 --> 02:21:00,234
(deeply inhales, exhales)

2660
02:21:00,318 --> 02:21:01,903
(Sandra clears throat)

2661
02:21:01,986 --> 02:21:02,945
-Tell me.
-I...

2662
02:21:03,029 --> 02:21:04,947
No. I just...

2663
02:21:05,031 --> 02:21:06,115
I thought...

2664
02:21:07,533 --> 02:21:09,869
I thought I'd feel relieved.

2665
02:21:09,952 --> 02:21:11,037
Well...

2666
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:13,331
(chuckles, sniffs)

2667
02:21:13,414 --> 02:21:14,999
It doesn't come right away.

2668
02:21:15,082 --> 02:21:16,834
(sniffs, clears throat)

2669
02:21:16,918 --> 02:21:18,753
(shudders)
You sure?

2670
02:21:18,836 --> 02:21:21,214
-VINCENT: I'm not sure.
-(nervous laugh)

2671
02:21:21,297 --> 02:21:23,299
Well...

2672
02:21:23,382 --> 02:21:26,260
It's just, you know,
when you lose, you lose.

2673
02:21:26,344 --> 02:21:28,012
It's the worst thing
that can happen.

2674
02:21:28,095 --> 02:21:29,889
And if you win, you...

2675
02:21:31,390 --> 02:21:35,770
kind of expect some reward...

2676
02:21:37,021 --> 02:21:38,689
but there isn't any.

2677
02:21:38,773 --> 02:21:40,483
-VINCENT: Hmm.
-It's just...

2678
02:21:42,485 --> 02:21:43,945
It's just over.

2679
02:21:48,783 --> 02:21:51,452
Maybe sometimes,
we expect too much...

2680
02:21:54,705 --> 02:21:55,915
Yeah, maybe.

2681
02:23:00,855 --> 02:23:01,898
(Sandra sighs)

2682
02:23:01,981 --> 02:23:05,568
SANDRA (in French):
Hi. Sorry.

2683
02:23:07,570 --> 02:23:09,322
(in French) He tried
to wait up but fell asleep.

2684
02:23:09,405 --> 02:23:10,656
SANDRA: Oh, oui.

2685
02:23:12,283 --> 02:23:13,409
SANDRA:
Okay.

2686
02:23:23,377 --> 02:23:25,796
(whispers in French)

2687
02:23:59,497 --> 02:24:01,123
MARGE (whispering):
I'll be going now.

2688
02:24:01,207 --> 02:24:02,500
SANDRA (whispering):
Not staying over?

2689
02:24:02,583 --> 02:24:04,418
MARGE:
No, I'll leave you be.

2690
02:24:05,044 --> 02:24:06,128
SANDRA: Oh.

2691
02:24:06,212 --> 02:24:07,588
(both chuckle quietly)

2692
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:12,093
BOTH:
Goodbye.

2693
02:24:29,151 --> 02:24:31,237
DANIEL:
I was afraid of you coming home.

2694
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:36,117
Me too, I was afraid to come home.

2695
02:25:22,997 --> 02:25:24,081
(kisses)

2696
02:26:22,974 --> 02:26:24,183
(softly groans)

2697
02:26:26,686 --> 02:26:28,187
(sighs)

2698
02:26:29,105 --> 02:26:31,440
(Snoop's paws clacking on floor)

2699
02:26:38,739 --> 02:26:40,074
(Sandra chuckles)

2700
02:26:58,801 --> 02:27:03,973
<i>(Daniel playing
Chopin's "Opus 28 No. 4")</i>
